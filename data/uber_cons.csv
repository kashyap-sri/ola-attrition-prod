stagnant growth and fixed working hours
It will be too early to comment.
Nothing i can think of.
You have to be very quick in learning to grow
Time is good . It's flelible
No salary and learning growth.
"People are just doing work as headless chickens, always fighting against short term strategy vs long term strategyWide disparity in pay in the same level and same org"
- Initial few days can be overwhelming because of all the responsibilities handed over to you
- Over time the org has become slow and less innovative- Quality of hiring has gone down over the last 6-12 months
- Demanding- Too much work sometime
Work delivery can get ambiguous
Simultaneous many things happening across globe
Work life balance can suffer if one is not able to manage time
"Absolutely no work life balance, no time to connect with team members, various medium of communication resulting in more confusion and delay, hell lot of meetings on a daily,weekly & monthly basis, very fast paced work life and aggressive approach, Uber employees expect overnight change/development, employees are paid way less if compared."
"Slow growth, however, if you have skills you will definitely be valued"
"Secluded office location, Occasional late night Sync up meetings"
Handling too many people at once.
Politics within greenlight centres and
1. Nothing as of now.
"but cannot enter in to on role ,no appreciation or team outings"
Nothing much. It is a pretty good place to work.
nothing i can think of
No cons as far as I remember
"Lot of work, 10 times more than the package they provide."
Only thing is we cannot meet HR Face to Face all through Emails.
It doesn't give you support and does not care for it's customers.
We are still finding our feet in terms of our work Culture. It's not the same what it used to be when it comes to speed of execution (to a large extent in a good way) but still 'agility' is our key strength and we can't let go of it.
Non so far. Hope there won't be in the future as well.
Less opportunities to grow with the firm
long hrsorthodox policies of the hr
Slow growth.Sudden process changes.Monotonous work.
none that I could find
- none that I could find
"Heavy workload at times, not always though"
Silo culture and Surprise organizational decision which suffocates the employee on his job security.
Lot of politicsManagement favours wrong peopleGrowth is slow
the strategies used by company are based on the work done by other companies they are not at all applying their brains.
salary and promotion. incentive term period is not proper
no cons yet to my notice
"nothing as of now, everything is fine"
"No week off, lot of politics."
Formal work environmentEmployees to worried to let their guard down
- Sometime work is too much
The con would be that since its startup the process and everything else is very unstable and highly volatile also there working patern and style and are defined and very messy all over.
For Field work. Nice. .......
Nothing much negative about Uber.
"As of now I have 0 cons with the company, wish it remains the same as I love working in here."
"It is still in a startup mode, if you are looking for MNC culture not the place"
There are none for this organisation.
Not Applicable/ No major cons found
"No promotions as fast , growth is sometimes in challange and some juniors could be lost in beginning .."
-Bleak chances of promotion-Be ready to work yourself off!
Work life balance is not that good.Always sprinting.
"1. Micromanaging, which sometimes feels very suffocating2. Too frequent change in working policies"
Lack of proper HR structure. Extremely flat teams in a large set up leads to chaos and lack of proper career path for the employees.
Pay scale although other benefits should cover it. Slower than Indian competitor but takes a higher commitment to quality.
"Rotational shifts and offs, with not enough leave days"
"tiresome work, high expectations from leadership, tools yet to be modified, transparency is feeble, less motivation by managers and very little interaction with the leadership team"
Not much growth and pay could be more
Nothing bad to mention about.
"Everything is streamlined, Nothing to say more."
Culture should be stringently followed
A bit downside on work life balance but its currently being worked on
Micromanagement. Pressure. Not great colleagues.
ManagementHierarchyNon transparentHeavy PoliticsOrganization Run by single Person
1) Work can get really hectic at times.
None as of now. Minor problems are always addressed immediately.
- Huge growth in headcount: High growth led to confusion on ideal growth trajectories- Competitive Culture: Appraisals and promotions were fairly cut throat and visible to weed out star performers and put pressure on other employees- Autonomy: Initial autonomy over time reduced as more central and management oversight layers were added
Super quick decision making leads to anxiety before results
Rotational shifts will take a toll on your body and your daily regimen. This might hamper your productivity if you're working just because it is your organisation business requirement.
work life balance is not the best
a bit slow in hiring
"Office politics is too muchnon cooperative collegues , very selfish sometimesWorking hours is patheticlow wages"
"As the company is settling down, the growth opportunities as a individual is slowing up."
Nothing such only that you need to have a sense of driver empathy.
"- None as such. If there is some issue, top management is very keen to hear and solve it."
A lot of experimentation is done constantlyOnce a startup now becoming more corporate
Has not spend much time in India. Have also to concentrate in the smaller cities for business growth.
working environment and not a technical job
"kids with spreadsheet, making un-wise decissions"
Improvement in everything is required from time to time . So I'd like to say everything can be improved slowly to make the company newer day by day.
Too fast for the people who are too slow.
As of now there is no such thing which i felt is not good or lacking here :) :)
"1. if you are used to a very structured and predictable workplace, then this may not be for you2. you have to be a total self-starter and self-completer too (everyone is as overworked as you!)"
- Work Life balance- Prioritisation
The company is still in its adolescent stage ( which is more than often a good thing).
"Slowly moving away from start-up culture, so in some areas things getting delayedAttitude issues at the lower level management which is not seen in top managementsome people do not fit to the culture cause hindrance to processes"
"Direct exposure with partners, employees must know how to deal with them."
"- Not much induction, you are Sea literally in first few weeks- Older Uber folks generally don't think person need time to adjust and things come at you very fast"
Coordinating with driver's maintaining fleet's
More of driver centric profileWill hire through 3rd party and it's difficult to come on uber payroll as when and then there's a opening they will hire people from outside mostlyLess pay
Pros are at the higher side so I have not found any Cons till date. Hope I will not come across any.
nothing. work pressure is there but that will be there in startup
There should be more focus on training people to acquire more skills
Its helpful for to me to work as team leader or supervisor in uber
too much importance to degree and institution
1) No work life balance2) Management problem where your made to work alot but your growth is limited due to your bad manager.
To be Frank Didn't discovered yet.
"There is no growth for people who work has contract , they take lote of work from the contract people they dont recognize in the from of perks ."
no increment of salary nor of designation
"1) Not for people who like to take it easy (my way of saying that while the work-life balance is great for me personally, not everyone may be cut out for it)2) Organization in constant flux, which means that there are a lot of moving pieces to navigate"
Sometimes you are stretched to long working hours.Pay is not as per the role requirement.No work life balance.Slow growth.
There are no such disadvantaged well there are very quite few.It's just not that everyone is aware of UBER so there is a lot of advertising should be done so that you people create an awareness to our customers.
"The work is such, that you have to be good at managing your time, or you would not be able to take time out for yourself."
Nothing as such. Company has a bit of politics and the people with personal contact with seniors have an edge.
"Work life balance goes for a toss. You will have to work hard and smartly to hit that sweet spot.Everyone at Uber is way smarter than your company's top performers and this comes with a challenge of it's own - managing these super smart people. This is still WIP.Disparity in salary, be sure to negotiate hard on salary."
Haven't come across any cons so far.
"Managing the work-life balance, some might find it tough but I find working here a compelling proposition."
Too early to commentMany policies and positions need to be created
Haven't come across any cons so far. I'm writing this to make it 20 words minimum.
work-life balance. not for people who value relationships
"You will always find yourself checking mails, replying to them and staying on top of things. The Employees end up working on weekends and public holidays too because a fast paced environment like Uber's demands constant access to mails and availability to complete an urgent task on any day of the week/month/year. It can be exhilarating for some, but overwhelming for some others."
Worklife Balance can be improved.
The work involves alot of time and talking to drivers.
No work / life balance - 16 hour days are commonQuality of managers is surprisingly bad over the past few months and as a result growth of team members has been severely impacted.
Long Work Hours apart from that there is not much to complain about.
"Lack of operational consistency and processes, projects may have low impact due to constant change"
I can't say there is any.
"Not recommended for people who want to work a ""normal"" office routine."
Complex organizational structure. The first few months are spent understanding the inner workings of the compamy and the place/purpose of each team.
"Given the growth Uber is still experiencing (both business and headcount), workers have to be agile and plan on adapting to new changes."
Process in constant changing and huge quantity of information to absorve André take care every day.
"-still building infrastructure, but this is a great opportunity to build process at any level"
"Due to it still being a ""new"" company, there are areas of improvement when it comes to HR policies. It can be frustrating when there is not a definite structure in place for some instances that happen and employees are left with unclear answers. In hopes that instances like this will be resolved within the next year."
Be more upfront and honest on all hands
Some constraints when trying to apply for a new role in the company.
The vacation leaves are scarce
I gave uber many tries. I'll sit at home for 2 hours or so before I get a ride. It is a waste of time. Riders will pay about $10 for a ride. Well I'll get paid 5.50 for that. If they pay $7 for a ride i'll get $3.50. That doesn't include me driving across town to pick them up.
"For the location, the salary could be a bit higher."
There are cultural differences within the company that may prohibit a long term positive environment.
- Low pay- Fast paced not enough structure- inefficiencies in work management
The school is not organized enough.
Depending on your team there are some teams still figuring out there footing both process and output.Some people have roles/titles and are not leveled up to what is required for the role they possess.
"Aside from Uber Learning, there seems to be little effort to train employees on other fields"
Lunch is just so so.
"If you live in the suburbs, the commute is tough. Other than that nothing is a CON"
1. Not Invented Here syndrome.
Takes time to hire people
The Lunch menu is limited
"Sometimes Uber may have a lil bit of bureaucracy, but nothing that would make you feel disappointed."
"Competition; odd contracts; uncertainty. There is an uneven pace to it all, but it bodes well with its centric office location. In essence, your job will be varied, and you will need to wear many technical hats; if you cannot learn on the job do not apply to this company. If you are used to having everything served on a silver platter, you will be sorely ridiculed, in many more (meta) ways than one."
Job tends to get monotonous if you stick only to the basic workload so the in-office trainings give you access to a more diverse workload. For some people the weekend shifts or the evening shift are a con as well but it comes with the job description.
- Better defined career progression would be great
"Lack of HR and not having a real management around, unexperienced leads are making the pressure harder. Though it depends on which county you’re working."
There is a lot of work and it can become overwhelming.
Lot of hustle required to fit
Not very organizedIt feels like a jobIt seems to be turning into a standard corporate environment
"Promotions don't pay as advertised . You sometimes have to work with Support to get paid what's owed . most times when speaking on the phone or through emails they are from another country and can't understand even basic English . If a disgruntled customer calls in and says there was a issue with the food Uber docks your delivery charge back to the customer . ( I once had a man call in on me because I wouldn't come into his home for a "" tip "" , Uber took my delivery charge off my account stating the man had said I ate just the sour cream and jalapeno's off his Mexican dinner ) If you deliver near a college or set of apartments be assured you will be climbing as many as 5 flights of stairs , customers will not come down and meet you . Some customers don't put accurate addresses in App so you have to look for them . You may drive 15 minutes to pick an order up then have to deliver 3 blocks away , you do not get paid for driving to pick up , only delivery ."
Training could be more prepared.
"It could have more benefits, this will retain more talents at the company"
"It is becoming a corporation, and some things get time."
"Management is occasionally disorganised. On the odd day, the Team Leads will forget to communicate things to the Greenlight Leads, so just make sure to follow up to ensure that it's actioned on time."
to many managers with no team
"I don't even know where to begin, everything I learned through my experience at Uber was basically a confirmation of things NOT to do when managing a team, building a new org, developing new processes, and implementing policy changes to external customers. Perhaps it's given me valuable insight into what doesn't work.The company grew quickly and has reached a size, in my opinion, that isn't considered a ""start up"" anymore. However, the tenured folks there still had that ""move fast, break things"" mentality without realizing that now their mistakes have a cascading affect across 100s of people working in their org. I'd like to have seen more strategic and intentional decisions versus experiments (sometimes even ignoring data) based on ""intuition."" I also continued to see people being handed roles only because they were there at the right place, right time.Middle management was the worst I've seen with first-time managers who had little understanding of how they should serve their team. There was no trust between my team and my manager although we got along well outside of work. With this type of management, there was no accountability into one's work and very little (if at all) individual goals.Dara's All Hands were usually inspirational, but I rarely felt proud about my work. I wasn't challenged and felt like I was wasting my time, not being able to contribute in a more meaningful way. My skills and experience wasn't put into good use.All of my coworkers are miserable in their roles and feels stuck. I pray that they will be able to dig themselves out of this hole and find something more engaging. The benefit was also SO BAD and management continued to ignore and delay a proper response despite MONTHS of effort from team members across the US to bring this topic to the forefront. When I left the company for a new job, my new salary literally increased by more than 3x of what I was getting at Uber."
* Lack of organization in sales procedures
The culture was kind of blah. Felt like constant competition and butting heads between Uber 1.0 and Uber 2.0
I honestly haven't come across any
Irregularities in rules among departmentsFunction segmentationNot much inter-department activities
First challenge is that to analyze the huge amount of data collected about drivers & customers. Second is that to find the best solution to improve the business and satisfy both the drivers & the riders.
"Culture change away from earlier dysfunction is real but incompleteProcesses can be unclear, unstated, or non-existent which can lead to poorer coordination or visibility into what's happening and who is/should be involved"
"- Responsibilities are split between experts to improve efficiency, although not quite sure if this is actually improving interactions with partners"
"In some ways, it's apparent how quickly the company has grown in that some of our systems are just catching up to our needs at scale. The great thing is that there are really good internal teams here that are building tools and systems to fit our current and future needs, releasing great tools every day."
"Management has their favorites so much so that favortism allows for harassment in the workplaceHR is gutting compensation right now.Culture is infested with arrogant, hypocritical bootlickers"
"With increasing scale of the company, the processes and the bureaucracy are appearing now more often."
Stressful environment at times.
I do not have any Cons about Uber
"Underpaid, lack of clear career progression"
"- Lack of transparency sometimes.- There's a line drawn between full timers and contract staffs. Etc. for some of our meetings or offsite events, it will only be extended to full timers. I hope this will change and some of these can be extended to contract staffs as some of these contract staffs have also been in the company for awhile."
it takes too much out of you. Too much of a fast paced environment and too short deadlines.
Growing quickly so individual teams are becoming much larger.
"None so far, continue to bring in a variety of professionals."
Unfortunate events led to the layoff of hundreds of hard working people passionate about developing autonomous vehicle technology.
"- not enough pay- favoritism everywhere- not possible to grow without being someones ""favorite""- schedule sucks"
"- Organization: With fast growth, it's easy for things to become disorganized - outdated docs, multiple redundant resources, etc."
"At times, it can be an environment with high pressure and strict deadlines.being it a global company you will at times have to do across the world calls at unpleasant times"
- Relatively long process of onboard due to size of the company and amount of systems.
Can't think of any cons as of now.
"Terrible salary and alot of unprofessional agressive people.It felt like working at a teleperformance at it's worse. Gossip everywhere. It was a very bad experience.Lack of information and processes.Career development based on how good you are to make managers feel they are your friends, is not about being professional and delivering a good result.Discrimination and racism.If you see something not working they preffer that you shut up and continue doing your rork, even if you can't deliver something good due to the lack of organization."
"I can't think of any so far, I have only been with Uber for a year"
Negative public image but is okay
- Doesn’t always feel like a meritocracy- Some teams have limited scope and opportunities- Strong sense of entitlement from some employees
"As a hypergrowth company, Uber needs to find a more sustainable model of growth.Unsurprisingly, it feels like a silicon valley startup, with a lot of ambiguity and extremely fast pace of change"
Sometimes you feel like there are not enough hours in the day to get everything done with such fast paced & quickly changing priorities.
- Recruitment is utter garbage. I was thrown between two recruiters because one of them left during my recruitment. The handoff between them was terrible. Mismatch offer info caused a lot of confusion. I stuck through it and it paid off at the end.
In the beginning you can not miss any days of training other wise your attendance recorder takes a big hit. Not a lot of free Uber swag.
"Getting bigger, so becoming harder to navigate"
Significant emotional stress.Low pay for the work.PTO is not designed to support hourly employees.Upper management is totally out of touch with support operations.
No cons. Everything is on the top level
"Heavily monitored work performance can create an uncomfortably high pressured environment, pay is slightly low compared to similar positions at other companies, very difficult customer base"
Crazy data restrictions that could get one fired unknowingly
"- Toe-stepping and backstabbing are embedded into the culture- People are not held accountable for failures, and it's very common for others to claim credit for your work- Limited to no training offered- Bonus targets change dramatically with little to no notice (whatever your offer letter says is likely to NOT be honored, especially bonus target and equity refresh)"
"No growth opportunities whatsoever, no appreciation for talent"
"Too many employees, sometimes very disorganized"
"long hours - no work/life balance, HR didn't address sexual harassment issues until it was publicized"
Bonus & Salary are below the average
Lack of local growth opportunities
The job role finished too early!
I have no cons to report.
Inconsistencies and poor of communication at times.
Have to care with customers
"- The company is always restructuring- When the company restructures, it ignores its experienced staff- You are paid less than the market- People operation / HR is quite a week and understaffed- Different offices are controlled by different dominant people and diversity is just thing on paper"
No mobility. No inner departmental promotions based off of performance. Management is clueless. Lack of communication from departments. Low pay. metric system that doesn't look out for the employee or take outlying factors into consideration. Safety for GLH locations.
"Young large corporates don't yet have clear reporting lines. This is positive (more room for initiative, more responsibility) but also means it isn't clear who you should approach with questions or concerns"
Private company so compensation isn’t cash
Very fast paced!A little chaotic at timesFood is meh
"Work really hard, travel a lot"
Too many meetings in a role.
Folks who have been here longer leave in waves. Their generally subject matter expects and can be very hard to replace.
leadership didn't change and should've
Lower level focuses at number not people
"No cons so far, great experience!"
- Office could be quite noisy at times.- Having a lot of users means a lot of responsibility. When things burn - they burn.
Culture can be a bit rough. There can be a lot of competition between colleagues. It does not always feel like you are valued in the company and feels like you could easily be replaced.
"Not very structured, open floor plan"
"Uber is a large company that hasn't yet figured out some of its processes. There is a surprising amount of hierarchy and a little disorganization (this isn't more, however, than at other companies, regardless of maturity). In the last three months there has continued to be some churn at executive leadership team level and, with new hires, the future is a bit unknown"
"They are slowly taking away/limiting all the good perks. Sick time and PTO accrue at a snail pace. The flu spreads like wildfire because nobody has enough sick time (however, they did offer free flu shots in the break room, made it very easy to get one). You gotta be friends with someone to get a promotion usually, in other cases they expect Uber to be your only one true passion to get promoted at all, doesn't matter if you're well qualified. Passion > Skills. I was told by management that if I'm not willing to give up family time I am not ready for a promotion, although I've been recognized countless times for my good work and contributions."
Targeted 5 ticket per hour in level 2. Means more complex and harder than level 1 ticket. Shifting start from 5AM.
You will never want to leave this company. :)
interview process is tough but they want to hire the best
Culture and values and ambiguity
Not much gets done anymore. New folks are not great at their jobs.
i didnt find any cons
"Pay is offensive until you are an L3 role or higher, which takes 3+ years to do from an entry level position.Extremely unorganized due to rapid growth.A large portion of management is incompetent and very under qualified."
-Culture promotes cutthroat individualism-You have to be prepared to defend your company when you tell people who you work for.-Constantly have to explain that you don't drive.
Work life balance & comp could be better
"Sometimes a little bit desorganized, a company that's still learning to prioritize."
Poor career path and growing opportunities
"- Management never really seems to know what they're doing- Major changes are implemented without enough planning- People are relaxed to the point where it's unprofessional- It can be difficult to progress if you're not in with the right people- Although pay and benefits are high for the area, it caps low overall"
Desperately need more senior women
Management sometimes lack 'management experience'
"Under Contract, Management was not up to par."
Yet to find a con
"Difficult 2 sided, sometimes 3 sided marketplace presents difficult decisions."
Some ambiguity with assigned projects but only because these are problems no one has solved before and allows you to think critically for yourself!
"Staffing is strongly linked to compelling needs and hiring is not completely allocated to regional teams. Sometimes there is the need to cover temporary vacancies, with increased workload"
- Need to wake up in the middle of the night if you're on the support rotation and something breaks (if you're an engineer)
Too much differences made between employees.
Terrible Culture and LeadershipLack of direction and integrity
Lunch food could be improved.
"NY office is in an inconvenient location. Very bureaucratic and political culture. Must stay in same role for 1 year before switching positions, regardless of performance. Low pay compared to comparable positions and companies."
Better heat map to help set coarse
"The culture is very open and casual which is not a bad thing. As a matter of fact, a lot of people see this as a plus. However, this might be a surprise or seen as a lack of professionalism at first for those who join the company from non-tech companies."
"Uber's reputation has been damaged in the past, but they're constantly improving to make everyone proud of the place they're working."
Quite some travelYou need to be used to working with dispersed teams
"-Growing too fast, hard to keep up-Number of employees vs. size of offices"
they Dont treat Drivers great
No cons to report at this time. Love my job.
"* Hard to come up with one* If you don't live in the city, some might say the commute (but they give you great flexibility on working remotely so not true con)* Some may say the food"
"almost no cons except Uber is at the edge of industry and paid more attention by media and society and being involved in fake or real issues. But the same issues happen in other companies, and only that no one cares about shadow companies they are not revealed. So as result Uber applied some policies more officially about any abuse or issue at work, so you may feel concerned about it."
There are no disadvantages to working for Uber
"* Constant apologizing, both internally and externally, gets tiring and demoralizing* Company is not treated fairly by media, lots of exhaggerated bad publicity"
I honestly don't have any
"The hiring process can be long and exhausting. Also, the company is known for having a very fast speed to deliver results, which can be overwhelming in the beginning."
none that I can think of.
"The best analogy here is like a 14 year old that looks like a 20 year old... Uber is still a young company and I think I expected more things to be in place that are just not yet. Now that I am here and doing the work, I see it differently, but I think that we're still young, we're growing fast, and we need to provide the feedback while also being patient to thoughtfully get the right systems and procedures in place."
no room for growth and management is poor
No other benefits/ contractualMonday-saturday worked and mandatory report even holidays
"-the training is rather very difficult, or atleast for me. I had extended training and was stressed out the entire week.-for the first few weeks, it was very hard for me to understand the process-the work is not hard, it just needs a lot of attention to detail"
The life/work balance might be challenging
negative press / in the spot lightretention of tenured employees looking for the next hot startupTreating contractors as second class citizens
"Perks are ok, not on par with tech companies of the same size."
"Sexist, backstabbing environment, poor pay, work 24/7. Hated every minute couldn’t wait to leave"
I don’t have any.
Still a young company with many foundational components that still need to be implemented
"Longer shifts. Personal preference on this.I'm easy going, I don't really see cons to working at Uber."
1. Some executives joined & left really quickly for various reasons which the company in general did not communicate well to employees
Very dangerous to ride a bicycle and it makes me getting tired.
Integrating processes is challenging in a company this big and operating in so many different markets.
"Staff working in silos, Management pursuing too many at the same time, Leadership vs Management (more magement than leadership)"
"The ship has turned. The strength of Uber was in its decentralized nature of operating. Empowering teamsOn the ground to make a difference and adapt to fast changing markets locally without waiting for someone in HQ to make a call.Now, especially in marketing. It’s full of folks trying to stroke their ego by centralizing the stupidest of things.I mean literally there are teams who do busy work of making decks that look pretty all day. Teams building empires.If you make a great PowerPoint deck, you’ll fit right in."
"Here in Egypt, the environment is good, but there's a great area of improvement. The company is still growing, and we are still in the process of creating a structured operations, so it can get messy and hectic for a lot of people who are used to organized operations."
"Everything is great, can't come up with any cons."
Process was a bit lengthy (about 6 weeks) but other that that I'm very satisfied with my experience.
"- As the company is very big, it's not always easy to produce a lot of visible impact.- Some processes are slow."
I honestly don't have anything to complain about so far.
"The company isn't as organized as it should be because it has grown really fast, however it can be a move that you can make in your team."
I am new here so nothing yet
"Overall uber has a good organization, but very unfortunate how uber work that adheres to the work of uber abroad can not be accepted by the people of Indonesia."
Young people in management need seasoning.
"Having to negotiate with restaurant owners (the most unreliable people in the world), depending on your manager-your work will speak for itself - not too much micromanaging, incredibly passive aggressive management style"
"Uber has long had an identify crisis whether it is a large start-up or medium-sized corporation. With this, many of the controls and infrastructure needed for a company of this size don't exist still. Also, given the space, priorities shift quickly. The hottest problem last half could be totally defunded the next, which can be frustrating."
- Little to no upward mobility- Frequent Re-Orgs- No transparency from management- Current Leadership has made poor decisions with no accountability.
I just completed 3 months working at Uber and until now nothing to say about downside.
I have no words to explain downside to work at uber
"Shifts (the schedule is different every week), repetitive job..."
A lot o f work
Salary is not high with respect to the needed work.
Lots of changes all the time but I see that as a positive thing
- standard salary- career path
- No Roadmap- No Leadership- No Calibration- No direction
"In March 2018, Uber sold its southeast Asia business to Grab and exited the market in this part of the world."
"A little bit disorganized in the HR department, but totally willing to own mistakes."
Everything is good for now.
"If I truly have any complaints, they are minor enough that I don't feel the need to express them."
"Bit far to commute from South Bay, but Uber Credits Helps a bit.Food is nasty, free food should have dignity as well."
"Pay could definitely be increased, more positions that pertain to the need of the job itself. Sending out lines of business out the department"
Nothing so far I love to work there.
"- Can be stressful at times, but all jobs can"
As company grew they started hiring cogs that would just fit into what they need and do things the way management would do it. They stopped celebrating diversity of experience. This cookie cutter model should be good for an IPO but will not be great for long-term success.
"Although having a relaxed office can fantastic, sometimes it's a little too much, and it feels like more of a social hangout than a proper work environment."
"- It can get very technical and decisions need to be made fast, which can be daunting at first"
The business is not very stable and often got negative news
Some toe steppers are really annoying.
"*Constant media attention and internal drama is soul-crushing*Underpaid and overworked*The need to always be ""on"" -- it takes a toll, no matter who you are"
A young company which need more experience to become efficient
"Progression is bad, they have preferred employees which they promote every 6 months"
Some teams can be not that goodPress hates us whatever we do
I don't like the so-called Uber 2.0
Decentralized/localized management works better; too much power on the HQ or Regional side is making Uber more bureaucratic than ever. Also does not move faster than other competitors to hit the right pain point at each locale.
"Overzealous company culture - if you criticize anything at all, you're seen as a detractor"
Sometimes hierarchy gets confused (startup feelings X huge company)Way too many project to deal at the same time
Not for now. - ..............................................................................
"Work-life balance can be tricky, but that's something you're able to set for yourself"
Not a place for people who seek for slow pace working environment.
- A lot of changes
Company is still figuring our many things
Can get lost in the frayIf you're not good at managing relationships you may not move up
"Senior management is still old school. In my personal experience, they value big shiny things over everything else. The way to get them to notice you is by making noise and fuzz and not a constant good work."
"- The company is so huge that learning to be diplomatic when working with other teams is a necessity. Sometimes the people you have to work with will not want to help you but you have to find a way to deliver anyway.- There was a period in 2017 when the company was in a deep cultural crisis. That was a weird time and things are very different now than they were pre-crisis. Uber is a little more grown up, but a little less fun than it used to be.- Some co-workers other teams have told me their work life balance is less than ideal."
"Difficult to terminate low-level personnel for performance, attendance or behaviorMeaningful employee development is improving but historically has been lackingTough to advance from ""lead"" to ""manager"" level within customer supportAggressive political correctness that leads to group think and stifles free and open discussion"
"- Many jerks (both brilliant and not). You'll find a lack of basic class, respect and courtesy in many groups.- Political players rising up faster than competent folks who gave sweat and blood to build and grow Uber to what it is today- Work-life balance not that good- Comp relatively lower compared to other options on the market. Process not objective and transparent.- Big company vibe growing. Energy and positive vibe of pre-media storm TK days no longer present. Old timers leaving in high numbers. Dara is a seasoned leader who will try to do the right thing but he is not a tech visionary/disruptor like TK. Expect to see more ""growth"" via M&A rather than products and innovative tactics like in the past.I fell in love with Uber but left with a broken heart."
"Big company mindset is sinking in. There are some reasonable tradeoffs being made around this, but if you really can't function in a large org this is going to disturb you."
"Does not offer insurance, income is not guaranteed, car wear and tear, no control of false ""bad reviews"" (some people will do this in order to get a 'free' ride)- affects total rating (which is a big deal from what I have gathered from riders)"
Not much.. So many good things to say
"Unprofessionalism, lack of experience, HR department is in various locations and not on site, budget issues, a bunch of things you'll come across you should not have come across in a entry level position."
"The hours are much longer than any other job I've worked in, but this is expected to change as we continue hiring more help"
"Still in startup mode, yearly changes in perf processes and career development"
"Lack of some developer productivity infrastructure - I've been wanting a virtual machine with a static IP for a while and I can't get it yet. But they are aware, acknowledge the issue and are fixing it."
Management needs to be more tenured. Pretty underexperienced
"Career pathing is pretty nebulous, and there's not a clearly defined path forward for people working in remote markets. The brunt of the opportunities tend to be in the regional hubs like DC, San Francisco or Amsterdam. There's a huge amount of scope for professional growth and learning, but it doesn't always come with a new title and a pat on the back.The flip-side of having a lot of independence, is that there's a certainly level of ambiguity to working at Uber. Employees are given a huge amount of autonomy and are encouraged to take initiative, be thought leaders and move the business forward. It can be a hard adjustment for people who are used to working in a more structured environment."
"good environment and management, free foods"
Not ideal for candidates who are at a junior level and below.
"When being a small part of a big machine, some of the work can be relatively tediousThe learning curve is really steep in a company with so many services and so much historyThere's quite a bit of complaining over trivialitiesLack of effective ability to debug code due to high number of systemsSome people focus on vesting and then moving onPublic perception, even within the Silicon Valley tech community"
Challenging and a lot information will come to you everyday
- Excess information can be overwhelm
"Due to the need of high-qualified workers, we can notice the lack of diversity within some teams."
Still under construction so thinks change a lot
- Overwhelming at first- Low bandwidth for teams
"In order to take best advantage of all the opportunities company has to offer, you should dedicate yourself and put your best game on."
"There is competition. But I don't see it as a con, once you're pushed to give your best."
"Sometimes people here expects too much from everyone, so the work/life balance needs some attention."
"Some of the old uber is returning unchecked. In particular the bad managers are now rising up after hiding and there are stories of intimidation and fear to control people. Today I heard a manager telling very new and junior staff while talking about money and stock at their work area, that uber only knows about them what he tells them, so if they want a pay rise, stock anything they should look after him (in a very not so joking way). Please don't let the old uber return, the new uber is a much nicer place to work."
"We need some work on process, but we are working on it."
"Difference between full timersOthers had gym benefits, some didn't"
Nothing to say about cons.
Lots of simultaneous demands and projects
"- The management was kind of full of themselves- They claim to be very open minded but heard two managers talk condescendingly about some of their employees. But I can't say that this is a reflection on the entire company, maybe it was just those two."
Can't think of any right now
"-Depends on your preference and mindset, but incredibly fast-pace work rhythm can be overwhelming"
"Reputation, unfortunately the company/team has gone thru some bad period, hopefully we are over that."
"Low salaries, very low year-end bonuses"
There isn't any down side it's a great company
"structuring of processes, with focusing on the areas of support."
"Company had limited cash at times, but that's what you'd expect as a growing startup."
"Absolutely toxic environment, upper management pitting managers against each other, disorganized yet over managed teams, no clear path to grow as an employee, new head of software too focused on details, constant reorganization.This is a very bad place to work."
"- Sink or swim (more of a pro imo, but depends who you are)"
"I am working at UBER since 2015 as ext employee and now iam FTEs employee , But really hope that the salary will be alittle bit more as the reposnability i have ."
There's a lot of Uber drivers out there which creates competition. Wait time in between fares.
The job task can change multiple times in one day
-Constant changes require fast adaptation
- Fast-paced environment- Unexpected decisions
"fast paced environment, you need to adapt to change constantly."
"Uber is still trying to establish a new culture by incorporating what made the old Uber successful while making the changes needed to become a world class tech company. This new culture hasn’t quite taken hold yet, but the majority of the company is getting behind it."
Nothing. I'm very happy with them.
"Poor leadership. Leadership and overall management didn't exist. Most are young employees doing very little and everything is over looked.   Employees handling the most sensitive issues (sexual assault, physical assault, fatalities) come into work dirty, talk about how much weed they smoke and how much they drink nightly.  If you are an uneducated, unprofessional person with poor hygiene, you'll fit in. It's similar to high school.Major things change on a daily basis. Like schedules, policies and procedures with little to no notice.Everyone tries very hard to be important. Always coming up with some ""amazing"" project that's a joke.Superiority runs free, and deep.They do not match 401k, and tell you about future raises that never really pan out.If you make friends with some stinky pot head that is in management, you'll be set. If not.. plan to struggle."
"Some process are not defined, as any start up, however they are working on it.Career path and job levels doesn't exist, super flat organization."
A lot of PR scandals affecting the environment of the company
"Work life balance it's difficult, as you are in fast growing company."
Fast-growing. This sometimes can be challenging for consistency.
- Continuous org changes (but can be consider as a Pros)- Sometime you have to work really hard (overwhelming and stressful)
"Since we are moving at such a fast pace, role lines are blurry. Most people here were hired to do one thing and are actually doing something different."
"Work-life balance can be hard to achieve, due to the high competitiveness it might be difficult to advance in your career."
"Can be a rough start, it is a big company that grew very fast. Some team processes are still designed for smaller teams, while at the same there is a lack of communication between some areas . This makes it a bit tough to navigate at first, though a) you get there and b) there are efforts from leadership to update structure and roles to avoid this problem."
Management is skewed. Not much room for advancement. To get anything done its going to take weeks before you get answers.
Not a full time employeeNo Uber credit
The company is not very popular in SF.
"The company grew up so fast that a lot of things were done without planning or without taking into consideration how that grow could impact the structure or employees. In the Bay Area we have more than 5 offices, so employees need to be moving between this offices and it's a waste of time.I have met employees who really like the ""start-up vibe"" and they are starting to feel frustrated because we are becoming more ""corporate"" in certain things."
No annual performance bonused. No work-life balance
Need to have Bonus
- Leadership communication- High senior leadership turn over- Some leadership can be deceitful or say they’ll do something for you and won’t
"Limited opportunity for growth, communication is not always great"
"The public and media perception of the company is disappointing but to be expected. I've seen nothing but positive signs since joining and fully 100% stand behind the senior management, and the strength of our new culture. You can tell management has taken on the task of fixing Uber's past problems very seriously."
late salary coming in
Too much red tape now and days
- Can be organizationally disorganized due to rapid growth- Job posting and actual job responsibilities are not always aligned
- Currently turning into a classic corporate with all its pros and cons- Very American in its ways of working and doing business
Uber is very inconsistent with promoting and job requirements. There is also no age diversity. We see partners of all age but the average age of management is under 30. They have no clue how to manage employees because there is not enough overall life experience.
"-constant reorgs that always will leave you on the short end of the stick (recent reorg resulted in a title change (no change in role or responsibility), find out at performance review that my overall compensation was cut due to the title change...brought up to management and HR with no action)-high dissatisfaction among employees towards management and the org-management does not care about your thoughts or opinions-management does not listen to your concerns-constant process changes, managerial changes, reorgs... (ie before dust settles from previous reorg...a new reorg is in happening)-limited internal mobility-no 401k matching, no tuition reimbursement-lower overall compensation with more duties and responsibilities as compared to competitors"
You will work hard and at times long hours but you always feel like the work is making a difference.
"The public and media perception of the company is disappointing but to be expected. I've seen nothing but positive signs since joining and fully 100% stand behind the senior management, and the strength of our new culture. You can tell management has taken on the task of fixing Uber's past problems very seriously."
Management level is not looking for big growthManagers are little bit biased
Everything. The management and the owner all need to be replaced
"Things changes so fast, that is difficult to stay in status quo evolution is a requirement"
- as the business in growing some changes come and go- management is learning on the move-
Poor management and poor communication in between HQ and regional leaders.
"The only con for me is the perception of the company in light of all the news articles that may paint Uber in a bad light. Our new CEO, Dara, has implemented many positive changes and under this leadership we will continue to grow, improve, and thrive!"
"The company is rife with politics which seem to be more pronounced due to the pace of change. Middle management is overly concerned with protecting and expanding its own turf. As reported widely, there are some very toxic managers that espouse an “us versus them” mentality to their teams."
"Some of the cons are that despite being told that grandfather laws and favoritism is something the company is looking to shift away from, even after a year later employed here, I haven’t witness any truth or change to this dreadful and ugly reality within the COE. Also, I wholeheartedly don’t believe that diversity and inclusion is a priority here, which is unfortunate because many of the contacts we support in SORT are people of color. Majority of the efforts towards D&I seem to focus on gay males or transgender. Extremely poor management and acknowledgement of toxic people with concerning work ethics. Currently, after several reports made from a handful of different individuals from different LOB’s in different shifts; employees leaving the company unwilling and involuntary, claims made from Racist to sexist and micro aggressive behavior about a specific lead who has went from day shift to night shift from removal of his team to now not having a team at all and holding the only position as a “floating lead”, there is a completely distrust towards upper management and the representatives that support the app users."
"On the con side of the tech debt problem I alluded to before, there are parts of the engineering process that are painful at times. We've been committing resources to fix it, but there's still a lot of room to improve.Different parts of the organization still feel oceans apart. Maps reminds me a lot of Google, other parts of the company feel like other organizations entirely. We still have a ways to go towards homogenizing our values and standards, but things are improving. Just be mindful of which team you end up on if you decide to join. that said, transferring is easy and encouraged.The media attention can be draining. The world can't seem to stop talking about Uber. In some ways it feels motivating to be working when all eyes are pointed your way, but it can also be painful to be put under such intense scrutiny."
Management still not transparent. No manager training being performed. HR function too weak. More effort needed for employees to feel valued.
"stagnant, low pay, boring and repetitive."
Put more effective to company
"Terrible pay, progression opportunities are limited by favouritism and/or Global policies"
Lack of defined paths to advancement
"There could be more work/balance and sometimes we change the strategy too fast, so it is necessary a lot of flexibility from the employees to adapt."
"- Not the company fault but some employees haven't understood that this is still a company and they abuse it like IBM or something- They are evolving, which is not wrong but just painful to people who don't like change."
"Most employees are much more competitive than collaborative (at least in Brazil, where I work)Most leaders are still white malesPeople outside the company don't see it as cool as it really is"
Not to much support and payment is done through a third party
11 hour shifts are tough
Don't really agree with Uber Eats and how much waste the business produced
"Career progression, no clear structure"
Too many politics and bad compensation
"-It's a big company, so some of the same slow downs of working between teams happens, but it's not as bad as other bigger ones.-The food isn't as good as competitors, the management doesn't think this is serious but a lot of people care about what they put in their body every day (nutrition and quality)-The program/platform breakdown can cause issues where some program teams don't allocate time for tech debt and engineering excellence.-The alignment between product/design/eng could be much better (work in progress)-No dedicated on-call program where the volunteers make extra $ and not everyone has to contribute. This is what the other big players do and is a more mature way of operating."
Uber fully empowers their employees to take vacations and time to recharge but work can get pretty intense.
Demanding tasks and learning on the job.
"Culture is geared towards drinking and there is so much tension between the sexes. News articles you read are true--it's a frat boy playground where white guys in hoodies rule. Women have less opportunity to advance because they are often told that they are ""not a good fit."""
Well cons.. I think it has more to do with the past of Uber as a company. It used to be a company with a really bad brand image and is always in headlines for making really big mistakes. But today I can say that my last six months we've been working so hard to make things better for our customers and we will be the company everyone used to love
-Pay is below average for big companies-Politics sometimes get in the way (although a lot less than other companies I have worked for)
- Some processes are not as well defined as mature companies. But the company is working hard to close the gaps soon
"Workload is large, business never stops"
The company is getting too big. More people = more bureaucracy = slower innovation.
- Latam Region is growing and we have a interesting workload- Everything moves so fast you'll need to adapt fast to survive
There's not a solid continuous learning program
Senior management is generally not seasoned enough to manage a company of such scale. Strategies change constantly.
"No cons at all, just the best place to work I had experienced so far. Definitely has none cons I had identified."
Very few processes since it is a startup but it gives you a lot of flexibility to explore and experiment by yourself.
"Work is intense and ever changing, the speed is quick and there is a very strong bias for execution."
"The company is actively improving work/life balance and compensation, but these are two areas could be cons:- Work/life balance can be a struggle at times, due to the fast-paced work environment- The company is still working to make compensation competitive to the market"
- Still figuring out HR: trying to implement big company policies with the impact of coming down as an iron curtain sometimes- Pay is considered too low and the 'excitement of your role' is treated as a financial benefit- As a relatively young company with a very flat organizational structure people considering working for Uber should be comfortable knowing they'll need to carve out their own career path
"High level of stress / pressure to deliver results.Although there are many (good) intentions and processes to reduce it, business always ends being the most important piece, and work/life balance is not in fact always as great as we believe it is / as HR wants it to be."
"As one of the fastest growing companies in the world, Uber has no schedules and the pressure to excel at your job can be a little overwhelming at times."
- Onboarding could have been much better- Work-life balance
"- lots of process gaps- may need to hustle at times, need to resolve a crisis ASAP sometimes- changes are sometimes implemented from the HQ without advance notice to the regional offices- depending on your own values, you may not like the startup culture"
"Given that Uber has more than doble month by month for a long period, there are some internal process that needs to be fixed."
"The training process is not where it should be and nearly everyone seems to have a bumpy ride on their way to getting the hang of things, which can be daunting. Also, because you are often the third point of contact for Drivers...many people need to be shown a lot of empathy and understanding, along with being told ""bad"" news from yet another source. This can make for somewhat uncomfortable and emotional moments for all involved. So if you don't have a lot of patience for people's emotions and a willingness to attempt to deescalate situations through compassion and empathy, this may not be the right place for you.The responsibilities for each location can vary widely and it may not be clear what is expected of you in any given scenario, even though your role is defined in detail. This is sometimes off-putting and can make you feel insecure about what you can, should, cannot, shouldn't, or absolutely NEED to do at any given time. Clarity comes with time and experience."
"Wear and tear on your vehicle. Possible creeps in your car, rude customers sometimes. The complexity of insuring yourself properly can be frustrating."
in some countries in LATAM we are not regulated so is is not so easy to work
The fast pace and passion cause us to focus on too many things rather than fewer more impactful ones.
"There's a lot of work to be done, which sometimes can mean long hours. Management is generally good about encouraging balance and time off"
"- Some inexperienced middle management- Many, many layers of middle management"
"Work is potentially 24/7. Anyone who is happy and fulfilled at Uber has in her/him an inner self-propulsor, and he/she is comfortable with accepting, as a tradeoff, that less time is left for personal life."
Constant change so while its a good thing you must be very adaptable
The payment wasnt that good for my homebased work office. Also there is still lot of unstability in the office.
"Although the culture, values, and diversity are amazing, very few employees do not share the vision and are not that ""open""."
"- Work/life balance: you will work a lot. Most of Uber employees are hard working and are not forced to stay at the office ( at the contrary, management will push you to respect your work life balance), but you will definitely work a lot.- Salary/Benefits if you compare to other sectors where you could probably be working (bank/M&A/consultant) and paid much more.- Vertical moves and promotions might be difficult depending on your area . Being a top performer at Uber is extremely difficult"
"- it's a bloody lot of work: if you love to take things on cruise control this is not the place for you. It's definitely not a 9-5 type environment (and I hope it never becomes that!)- public scrutiny: you need to be thick skinned as not everyone will love Uber as much as you might. Whether it's an unhappy driver partner that you need to win back over, or a know it all relative at Christmas lunch, you will find yourself talking about Uber 24/7 (and often defending/explaining the company). It can be draining and you need to be ready for that.- crazy amount of change: personally, I love the pace of change, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you like routine and hate ambiguity and seemingly endless changes this is not the place for you. If you are happy to roll with the punches and make the most of every situation, then you will do just fine."
"-Only just starting to build out official training/development programs, although making great progress-Benefits in non-US locations aren't stellar"
"Not a place for people who love big, bureaucratic companies."
"There is a gap in Equity and benefits between old school and new employees, but HR is trying to work on that."
"As with every growing tech company, too much to do, not enought ime."
"Competitive environment, suitable for top performers but not great for more collaborative mindsets; management sees individual development as a box to check, not as a core management practice"
Center of media attention is not always positive (and many times completely unfair) / Governments are not always open to innovative companies such as ours
-Could be a challenging environment for people who are uncomfortable with uncertainty and like very direct management-Growing pains from becoming a very large team very quickly. Uber is catching up on HR and learning and development industry practices
Sometimes the fast paced growth can be challenging.
Work life balance might not be the best out there
Work can be overwhelming sometimesYou need to be able to work in a place with a dynamic structure
None none none none none
There's no clear compensation strategy for program managers.
"The company is growing very fast and you need to be a dynamic and resilient professional to overcome all the challenges that comes with fast growing. Not a cons, but a important thing to know."
"Sometimes you can work until late, but it's not usual at all"
"Needs to deal with drivers and partner, people are often rude and arrogant. Managing them is a big hectic job."
Getting more bureaucratic as it grows
"This is not a 9 to 5 place. If you are looking for that type of job, Uber is not the place for you. In addition, career planning is still a WIP an whether opportunities open each day, for those looking for more certainty and structure about their growth it could be challenging"
- processes change constantly- first time managers
- Company currently caught in a negative press cycle that seems to feed itself- Offices not as nice as Google or Facebook (At least until the new HQ is built)- Work hours in the 50-60 hours week range instead of the 30-35 hours week range at Google / Facebook
"Company grew too fast, resulting in some bad hires."
Competition is a big war
Rapid changes which can be very disruptive
There is a serious leadership void –&nbsp;extremely few good leaders. Most managers/leaders are self-serving. You are expected to be always-on. The culture is still very toxic.
Young managementToo many changes too soon
"Lack of career pathing. Everything cool that goes on at Uber takes place in SF, so regional offices get overlooked."
"Misguided corporate activities with large financial consequences. Support (24 hour has lengthy wait time) and email support difficult to find, and no access to calling local office."
- Processes still being implemented- Constant change- Growing pains
"As the office has grown, some of the community feel is starting to disappear. Projects still have massive impact, but we are starting to have a lot more people contribute to something that one person used to do (which is a good thing for quality & work life balance for sure)."
1. Need to improve employee's morale2. Need to formalize long-term tech vision3. Need to hire more top talented tech leaders
High stress levels and difficulty to achieve certain goals due to the regulatory context. Some managers have little experience managing high performing teams.
"Hard to be promoted at f you start as a level one employee. If you start out doing something they don’t like, it will haunt you for your entire career even if you’ve stopped a long time ago."
All the Toxic Managers hired prior to Dara are still here and still killing the company.
Awful support. Unable to deliver during bad weather. App sometimes has issues.
CEO is highly business minded and does not always think empatheticallyPolitics in many orgs
"It has growing pains: the HR on-boarding process is disorganized and information scattered, a simple cheatsheet will help a lot even. With the size of the company some startup practice is simply not effective anymore, need to get over this stage."
"As with most tech companies, change is very fast and communication could use improvement. Compensation is lower than many high tech firms, but good benefits."
Uber is a highly competitive environment. You basically always have to compete with tons of talented people for a promotion.
"The managerial structure is very poor. Most managers have no idea what they are doing and their incentives do not always align with the teams incentives. This has been improving, but a legacy of bad management is hard to overcome"
Salary should be higher than it is.
"I have nothing to list as a con, benefits and compensation are more than fair, management is open and honest about the direction of the company, priorities are clear, and the road ahead is open to advancement and personal development."
"Lack of communication inside the company is still a problem and I don't see it getting fixed any time soon. I do feel a lot of times, decision making is pretty much top-down. Onboarding experience needs to be improved a lot. Product goals are not well aligned between different orgs. Overall, I don't feel that a lot of folks care very much about others and what they do.Upper management is still being stabilized. Some folks who joined 3-4 years ago are leaving, but this situation is understandable and common in startups at this stage."
-Ambiguous structure at times-Below market base pay
"Overly beaurocratic, even if superficially pretending to be casual. Said to still posses the startup culture - utter BSPromo process so heavy and beaurocratic that it's easier to quit and come back re-evaluatedNot a place for loners, introverts and quiet people. So much insistent on constant communication, documentation, meetings, syncing, retrospectives, 1:1s, all-hands, RFC reviewing, to the point where it's hard to just sit in peace and do some actual coding."
- Some remnant of old culture still exist but are far and few
Salary is very very low according to the rates in Egypt and the inflammation rates.
"Work hard, but pays off!"
a bit disorganized and caotic
The benefits took an extra time to arrive but worth it
Can be long days and hours but that is dependent on the team and projects
"To get higher on the career, its mandatory to move."
"We grew so much and so fast, that we still have to become a more mature company, with more standardized processes and more mature leaders. Also, as we're still growing, sometimes that means working longer. But with the new management we're in a great path!"
"Great amount of work, needs discipline to keep the work-life balance, tough decisions every single day demanding good problem solving strategy"
To have more and better tech equipment.
"With the rapid growth, you can expect long hours - but everyone is very respectful of your schedule and personal needs and the environment is one that makes time fly."
We are still in high growth so things can get messy from a process standpoint from time to time. Things change super fast internally.
"It used to be great two years ago. Now, with re-org, getting business more scalable, it became corporation. For some people it might be good. However, you can also see that the company does not care about employees anymore. No HR involvement in re-organization shows lack of respect towards employees."
its tedious sometimes to deal with people
Need to be able to manage quick turnarounds and fast moving projects.
Overall you need to be used to changes. At Uber we go through a lot of changes and feeling conformable with that is something that will help you succeed at Uber.
"If you are a girl, you are not taking into account that much. At least in the NYC office."
"- The fast growth was also a bit painful. Constant changes, switch of priorities every time and we didn't really got to plan anything, just react and deliver.- Its very hard to be in a company so publicly known, where you see negative news almost every day... most of the times these are not entirely true.- As we grew so fast, we tried to grow our people very fast too. We got to a point where we had lots of young managers - that were first time managers."
-Poor balance between personal and professional life. It has been quite stressing but leaders are actually working on fixing this-Some managers are young so we still need to improve trainings for them-I started as EXT and they changed some tenure rules which caused pressure and conflict among my team - which hasn't been solved as we've expected
At present growth opportunities (for positions beyond Sr. Engineer) seem limited as opposed to SF.
Still working through some challenges from 2017 but they are San Fran centric. LATAM can feel a bit remote which is good for somethings but not great for others. We have to fight for resources and investment.
Im really happy and proud with everything we are doing
"I have gone through several changes in processes because we are growing really fast and becoming a well-established company. This means hard work, learning to adapt and cooperate with change management. This is also time-consuming but it is definitely worth it!"
Uber is becoming more and mote mature so roles are becoming more specialized.
is a new company with many things to learn
"Hard to make important changes in the organisation, even if it comes from many employees"
"Mid-level leadership still too junior and poor management from the top in many organizations.Cash compensation is still below market, but slowly trending upward."
The food could be better and yes there are long work hours and 401k would be nice.
- The structure is constantly changing to the point where it makes it difficult to do your job.
"On-boarding is not the best, leading to a steep learning curveLack of clear responsibilities means you need to define how you want to workConfusing org structure means it is hard to know who to talk to"
Things can change fast and it's important you are able to keep up to speed.
"Some HR problems, lack of transparency on comps & benefits. Differences between what you agree to and what is actually implemented."
"No job is perfect, but this is pretty close."
"Fast-paced environment. things are ever-changing, nothing is stagnant"
"The Salary is Poor,that is all"
* nothing to say yet .
The strong personality of every employee at first time makes hard to communicate in a correct way
"Young organization: as a Senior Manager, you need to bring your A game to contribute in the people management area."
Things should be created from scratchBenefits could be better
Very public eye on everything you do.
"Due to the intense volume of work and responsibility the salary needs to increase a little bit, at least three hundred reais more."
The company is still developing itself and it's identity as it gets into different market and that requires structure. Uber grows at an amazing pace but without proper structure making it sometimes a bit chaotic.
"You live in SF, no clear path moving up the corp ladder"
- The salary expectations were not met due to taxes in Poland- Took longer than expected (2 months) to get my benefits such as gym card
"Very fast moving, low margin for error"
"Internal mobility/promotion is a long and tedious process.In the last 6 months pay, job duties, shifts, and just about everything has changed and mostly for the worse.VO job feels insecure and unstable - feels like management is trying to tighten the rules to find excuses to fire people to avoid having to hand out layoff packages."
Dont have the best reputation. But with focus on our Drivers and work culture we will get there.
little to no opportunity to move up
"Recognition, if there is something to be downsided i assume that is the recognition Uber isn't really aware of how community developers nor QAs or even content specialists are doing or paying much efforts to done its business, this is really a sort of thing to be noted and i hope so."
"Lack of structure, very high turnover rate for senior level management, doesn't think things through before releasing products/updates/logic changes. Prone to hearsay from gossip- a lot of ""facebookesque"" drama."
Some of the best culture and some of the worst. There is some amazing stuff that goes on at Uber but there are some really terrible people also.
Pace of change is relentless. A lot of growing pains while we wrestle with our scale and growth.
"There is so much work to do, which is great. But learn to take some time out every now and then"
HR very disorganizedPoor communication between areas
"There's a clear difference in appreciation for NorthAm employees and support center employees. Changes are always happening swiftly and without your knowledge or extremely last minute. Culture has gone downhill since I've been there (2+ years). Also, there's not a clear pathway for career development unless you want to be a team lead or manager. They don't care that you're college-educated. Favoritism (in more ways than one) is a large factor in growth opportunities - this has been voiced and ignored as far as I can tell."
A very limited growth opportunity.
"A tendency from mamagement to treat low level staff like spoiled children instead of working, intellingent adults."
"Shady company, does not care about drivers only about riders if that. Some people don't get it but sometimes you work for $ 9 to $ 10 an hour after you deduct expences fuel taxes and knees fees."
"Paychecks often wrongs, employees repremanded for taking earned pto, blackoutdates, people fired for taking their earned paid sick time while on sick time, people terminated for subjective performance reviews, management favoritism, doctoring of data, 20 year olds in charge of your account security, no HR contacts or replys, harrasment, bad management, no phone/fax/department for employees to call with issues, and non trancparency of fares and customer service processes. Unethical through and through and this is late 2017 after they ""changed."""
Very fast moving but one can expect from a growing company.
Teams are so large it's sometimes difficult to stay on top of what's going on.
Probably improve my work life balance
Cannot be an Uber Driver while on payroll.Deal with difficult customer service issuesBecome familiar with a lot of different programsMis-information on the web and old information is a challenge to correct
"- compensation could be higher- I've maintained a strong work/life balance, as the company encourages this. However, a large proportion of the work force at Uber do not. As a result, I have concerns that that is expected of me from my team.- Not all Senior Management in ANZ seem to be aligned on the future of Uber. We'll have to see if there's proof in the work completed over the next 12 months- lack of consistency worldwide in job role. As a result, compensation is not necessarily reflective of work performed"
Can't think of anything right now
For must of us is difficult to stop thinking about the enterprise and how to develop new ideas or solve any issue.
"Support system, miscommunication, broken promises"
Until now I do not have any Cons
"we represent the face of uber, that means we can be ""beaten"""
"None, everything works perfect for me"
"This company still is young and is growing up here, in Brazil. As a result we can see points that need improvement, for example the alignment in the informations and procedures on greenlight."
"lots of politics, taxing to many and can be extremely frustrating"
There are still some lingering affects of the former regime. Some employees feel the baggage of the past. Ongoing Waymo suit is a drag.
The negative press associated with the company feels a bit harsh. Need to do better a job at communicating the good stuff happening here.
Aggressively hiring/moving meant it was hard to establish connections
- Sometimes time shift and global teams might harm communication;
Paid monthly rather than weekly
I don't believe there has been anything about working for Uber I have found dissatisfying.
- Career pathing is non-existent- Compensation needs a facelift- Tenured employees carry a poor morale that looms on the office as a whole
I honestly have no cons worth mentioning. This was absolutely the greatest place that I have ever worked in my life and I hate that I had to leave.
"Process updates communication is important to know what to do before changes apply, is the only thing I can say"
"Negative press, dispersed and distributed responsibilities and ownership"
Most systems are premature(except for the main Maps/mobile).If you get stuck in Benefits questions or laptop (ussh) then you will go around in circle(there is no single phone number or IT chat)Watch out for Salary Negotiation team.
-Hours are not ideal (ever)-All employees are underpaid-Promoting is nearly impossible-No 401K matching
If you don't feel comfortable with fast changing environment can be very stressful.
Being remotely is difficult since you do not have the same benefitsExplain better benefits in hiring
"The only con would be PR situation that Uber found itself in, only partially because of their fault"
Not being able to choose which benefits would you like to use.
"Rapidly growing company so some bumps along the way, negative press."
I do not fell Uber pay me good for all the job that I am doing and in general people in here fell the same.
"Management and leadership is too lenient and considerable, which is why most of the employees take advantage of this. Employees are too complacent and slack off. The managers and supervisors no longer observes or provides coaching on a regular basis."
"If you are the type of person who cannot handle confrontation whether its in a good or bad situation, this probably is not the right occupation to take on."
"- flat salary, no chance for a rise- no opportunity for personal development- no free weekends, mostly at work"
"management does not have valid leadership experience, they steal your ideas with creative exercises one must complete to get a promotion or make lateral moves and then you don't even get the job, incompetent people are promoted over people that are consistent high achievers with proven leadership ability, they are understaffed on various teams and place unreasonable expectations on said team members, they are reactive instead of proactive, and they ignore complaints about problematic employees and members of leadership."
"Management is horrible, and so is work/life balance. The pay isn't worth it."
"Poor pay, horribly managed environment, mistreatment by drivers, blatant sexism and favoritism, unqualified people getting promotions, and emotional exhaustion & burnout. Also, HR rarely pays attention to reports of unethical & illegal activity."
have yet to find one
"Because Uber is expanding so fast, sometimes global teams work in a disjoint manner"
"Uber is known worldwide and a lot of people have personal views that they feel they want to share with you, even though they may have never used or dealt with Uber as a company before."
Learning is limited due to the repetitiveness of the activity
"Because Uber is such a largely known global brand, I expected to be incentivised more for my work."
read the news.. its all in the news
Too many org changesToo much controversyLost its ambition
The only downside I see is that it's too far from my house.
Sometimes communication is a problem.
none as of the moment
Company's policies and processes change with local regulations
"- Startup feel, so there's still way too much to do, (but there's lots of opportunities)- Sounds like budgets may get a little tighter going forward"
A lot of projects are running at the same time. I feel that sometimes the company should have more focus by prioritizing some of them.
The salary is quite poor
Could be a bit chaotic.
Some people have a big Ego just because we work in a Tech Company.
"since is really young, we have a lot of opportunities from the people side"
Sometimes feel a bit lost with all the technologies. Many teams assign us bug reports without adequate information.
"Somewhat unorganized, expectations of sales of sometimes unreasonable."
"Many roles still ambiguous and still relatively fast changes. 2017 has featured uptick in attrition in senior levels and pockets of company; was close to zero (voluntary) in years prior owing to valuation increase. (As you can probably read about in a news search.) Controversial in most parts of the world, and polarizing in certain circles of people and areas."
"ManagmentThe company itselfDramaGotta be a ""cool kid"" to move upMost people have an above average IQ"
There are still some processes that need to be improved.
"The reorganization.I was hired as a Test Operator and I loved the work we did. It was challenging and fun. The managers cared, listened, and respected us. We were a productive, engaged team. I was happy and, as far as I could tell, so were the rest of the test ops team. I felt like I made a difference.But it was too good to last.... They announced a reorganization complete with all new job titles. One of the job descriptions was almost exactly the same as what we were already doing but we were told we would no longer be allowed to do this work anymore. We would need at least 6 months with Uber to apply. Our department had not been around 6 months and all but a handful of us did not meet that requirement. The good news is that this new job would come with a raise, if you were able to get it.Our new job would be VO, the job duties were significantly decreased and we lost some of our benefits. We were merged into another department and now work under their management.The work now feels meaningless and empty. I’m unsure of the short term goal and can’t seem to get a clear picture of how the reorganization contributes to the longer term goal in any meaningful way. I’m struggling to keep motivated with the loss of direction and my role in improving the technology through this new position.Our new managers play favorites with the people they have been working with from the beginning. We’ve had no opportunity to get to know the people we work with/for.Most employers grandfather people in to their benefits/job duties when they make a decision to reorganize like this. It shows respect for the talent that you have recruited with the promise of these benefits/duties."
* Not public yet* No onsite chefs :)
"Too many overnight operational changes, Experts (on the frontlines) receive information on these changes too last minute with barely any explanation or instructions on how to deliver these changes. Upper management/operations unfortunately like to hide behind their computers and expect the underpaid Experts to take all the heat. Management does not care about employees, too cheap to spend on things that miiight make for a better workplace environment. Managers often talk to employees the same way they talk to drivers, making them believe what they are doing/subject to is normal. For tri-weekly meetings, you are required to stay after work hours and are NOT PAID for 30min to 1hr gaps between working hours and meeting. There are MANY features of the operation that are marketed as beneficial to the driver however they only benefit the rider (upfront pricing). Managers are too focused on their bougie lifestyles and don't care for the people working for them. The role of an Expert is something I would not wish upon my worst enemy. Only reason I rated 2-stars is because of the benefits. They're good but not good enough to keep me in a job that will send me to the madhouse."
"Dealing with angry people or those with difficulty to understand as they can hardly express themselves, specially people from Far East."
"- Centralisation ongoing, loss of autonomy, but still better than most companies"
Some people are not very responsive and friendly. Morale seems low in some departments.
devalued position based on feedbackno direction on where accounts should gono clear career ladder
"Uber has a bad reputation right now, and that can be tough to deal with."
Pace and pressure generate high workloads - not for those looking for a 9-5 easy job.Still facing into a number of issues/scandals giving negative press/external perception.Growing rapidly - some of the controls and processes are catching up to the scale of the biz today.
There can be issues with authorities and that may cause uncertainty
"Mean culture, many unfriendly colleagues, unqualified and uncaring managers, missing ethics"
"due to all the hiring efforts, at time process within various departments on cross-function projects can be a little disorganized"
Cannot think of any... maybe food can be better.
"Gotta have a clear view on what GL's goals and what's the future plan, so we can support to achieve the goals"
- Reality vs. media perception of vision or tactics do not always align
Extremely unorganized with little to no direction. Office is extremely segmented and separated by a couple of floors. There is no current career pathing structure in place so visibility from role to role is very limited.
"Maybe , we should have less ""contractors"" in our day to day business, to reduce disputes between them."
Nothing to mention so far
"Low compensation, Lots of salary disputes. In terms of the job itself, the company is making us their robots. We just follow this set of policies, and punish drivers/riders who are being reported without proper investigating it. This makes the riders get more refund every ride, because we just basically believe everything they say. And also easy for drivers to fake Cleaning fee claims, which can charge riders up to 250 bucks."
"It is hard not to get whiplash at times. Decisions with get made, reversed, and then made again. There is a good bit of growing up for middle management. The top level managers are starting to set that course and over the next year things should solid up."
Sometimes people will assume negative things about Uber employees because of the bad press.
"A lot of turf wars and poor behavior. The environment is challenging for women, a lot of dismissals and some politicking."
"Payroll issues, the need to manually file holiday pays and etc manually, HR processes"
Because the company is fairly new there is not always a clear process and often the ability to knowledge share between groups is difficult.
None so far. 3 months now
"When work slows down, there is not much to do."
"It has to provide access to job training because many individuals do not know how to do their jobs. There are many folks who have been with the company for years, and classic startup, have been promoted to management roles without spending the time actually getting the necessary experience. There are many managers who are first time managers. This leads to chaos, a lack of organization and inability to take action on behalf of their teams and fix issues. Teams are over worked and under compensated. Reorgs are constant. Teams are not encouraged to work together across orgs. Promotions are given based on friendship and how long you've been at the company, not talent, success or ability."
My experience has been way better than what you hear in the news.
"- Recruiters are frustratingly inept and lied about job title- Upper management has made several sweeping changes without having a throughout (or even slight) understanding of day-to-day operations.- Recent organizational changes have resulted in a reduction of hours, benefits, and responsibilities for those in my role. The job I was hired to do is now being pitched as a promotion to my current role, effectively meaning I and many others received a wrongful demotion. Uber is walking a thin line between immoral and illegal with this change."
leasing division is closing down
unclear career growth pathlow incentive schemes
"Uber's a really controversial company and while we know internally that we try to do the right thing, the world often doesn't see it that way. It can be really exhausting to constantly see your company portrayed negatively in the media. It also becomes a bit exhausting to explain the situation to your friends and family. This exhaustion can sometimes be felt at the office.Additionally, while Uber's tried quite hard to keep itself transparent, the speed at which the company moves can leave you feeling like you don't know what's happening in your own company. And at the moment, there aren't enough company-wide events that help alleviate this."
"* You may end up with a complete sociopath for a manager, someone who is managing a large team before learning to manage a single person, someone leading a team of engineers who doesn't have engineering chops.* Hard to change teamsIf you are lucky and don't get a psycho manager then it's gonna be great. If you end up with a bad manager your life could be hell."
"Too early to say anything but an awful amount of work needs to be done in the Voice Support area in NorthAm. Hoping we can address some of the key issues such as Culture, Communication Skills and Additional support for all voice accounts from an Uber standpoint and not just rely on BPOs to skill their frontline staff."
Long hours and unsociable shift patterns but you get your rota 8 weeks in advance so you can plan around this.
If you do not like to work hard this may not be for you.
"At times communication lacks - really depends on your direct supervisor. At this time, there is no pay for performance bonus models for high achievers."
"Nothing to complain about, if so bring to management and work it out."
Benefits can be improved to be more family-oriented
Toxic corporate culture and management that does not care.
"Be prepared to enjoy your work AND to work hard. Hours are long sometimes, but it's worth it."
"- Still stabilizing, a lot of processes are being formalized. This can slow things down, but ultimately the company is constantly learning, changing, growing in a positive way."
The working environment is not good
"Earlier on, the environment seems a little colder and office event participation is very much lesser. After a few office events were set up, staff bonding is at a much better level. Staff are now more eager to participate in office events being held. People now shows more trust & cooperation when a better bond is created. Work runs more smoothly."
"As best as the company tries, as a place that's growing this speed, communication will tend to be the biggest problem. I sometimes feel I don't receive information as quickly as I wished I had."
Company struggling to operate as a large company
"There is at time redundancy/conflicting projects among teams, and this can be sub-optimal."
- Salaries not as high as FB/GOOG/MSFT- Management figuring out right amount of process will take some time- Lack of clarity about Uber's true value as a company
"Pay is usually below average for similar job titles, but is usually outweighed by other benefits"
Production oriented and some long hours.
not enough structure for an intern.
"Despite growth, still startup trying to do more with less. Very much a stay lean and cheerful type culture, which can lead to overscoping. But you don't join Uber for the work life balance, you do so to for a chance to change the way the world works for the better. We have the privilege of a real honest-to-goodness opportunity at doing that every day."
Hard to outline a single con
You have to be careful with the worklife balance.
- college-quality food- things move very quickly
I have not come across any cons
Data can be more organized
I guess you've heard this before.. The food is free but not that great. Although I very much appreciate the fact that it is free.
"Young inexperienced workforce, politically heavy in regional offices."
that the boss are way to call
- Stress- Strict work culture
"It's also the fast-paced environment, as you learn and expand your knowledge, you are always outside your comfort zone. Sometimes I feel that I need to take some rest."
Small Pay and hard to grow
- low pay-limited upward mobility-inflexible hours-monotonous daily tasks with no variation
"-Not long term, it only lasted for a few months-A lot of necessary paper work you have to complete after every ride"
It is impossible to get support for bad deliveries or to correct payment errors. It's not even worth trying and is quite frustrating.
Cheap company. They never care about workers.
Working together in teem spirit to archive the company goal and contribution of ideas makes the job very easy
"Inequality, inefficiency, lack of organization and clarity."
- still rocky since TK's departure- there's A LOT of foundational work that still needs to be done
"Super fast learning curve, everything is learning on the spot and I personally love that but I know that it may not be the best way to learn for everyone."
HR is terrible. very unfair
"work life balance, 10 to 6 is my entire day and by the time i get home after 45min to an hour of commute i am tired and ready to sleep just to wake up for work at 8am again, cant make a doctors appointment because everywhere opens 9 to 5 or 10 -6."
"Super fast pace, highly demanding, highly stressful."
Career growth is slow for employees.
"Because Uber is now beginning to ""realign"" and formalize as a company, there are many aspects that seem to be somewhat ad hoc. As the company matures these processes will become formalized."
"Giant startup, with some communication flaws, where sometimes it is little and in others it is too much."
- Struggling to hire so teams slightly understaffed due to external reputation but that is starting to change
Some of the reasons that you can be terminated is a bit alarming and I feel can be better corrected through progressive discipline. However maintaining focus will prevent a termination. #stayfocus
Thankfully none that comes to mind
-The long shifts 10 hour shifts 4 days on 3 days off-Communication between management
Management implements initiatives that are not thought-out or prepared to handle internal crisis-communication; sales commissions were not paid correctly for 5 consecutive months from May 2017-October 2017.
"Culture is lacking, and people are really to themselves."
- can be a bit chaotic to a new person- hard to plan for future work as new things keep coming
Poor leadership from the top of my org.Xchange Leasing closing.
"- The holiday attendance policy needs to be revisited. I understand why COE COS/agents are expected to report to work on a public holiday, but for those who work in the COE but aren't agents/aren't handling tickets, I don't understand why it's really necessary for us to be at work (think of the money that could have been saved by letting some employees have the holidays off instead of spending it on paying employees' holiday pay, electricity, etc.). The fact that we are expected to be at work even on holidays was never explicitly communicated to me during the hiring process, either.- New employees don't seem to be properly oriented on policies, processes, etc. - the first few weeks can be quite daunting."
May be a bit too much comms and meetings
"- Ebb and flow of work - I will have some slower weeks and then longer, more stressful weeks. Not really a con and more a part of the job"
Not that flexible schedule. Communication sometimes needs to be worked on
"The pressure on engineers sometimes is too highAlso often there's way too much process - plannings, RFCs,"
"""There is a high cost to a bad reputation."" We know exactly what we need to do, and that is to be accountable for past mistakes, develop a better culture, celebrate our cities, and move forward."
"The workflow makes you spend more time of the day at work than at pleasure. Many times our workflow is interrupted by local authorities, due to the regulatory issues"
"Lunch and dinner food isn't the bestSome teams seem to be very fast paced, but work life balance is getting better"
"Some of the people in leadership are too young and immature for their roles. They are really bright and driver, but that doesn't necessarily make them good leaders. There is a human aspect to being a leader that is lacking in some. The compensation team was never a team that thought the people were the most important aspect of the company. When negotiating salary shoot high otherwise its going to be really tough once you sign."
I feel that anyone cares about who you are or what happens to you. Maybe 1 person at less and that makes us know less as a team.
"Horrible management, inefficient systems, trial by fire mentality. Management is out of touch with workers. Supervisor positions are based off seniority and not on 'meritocracy'. All new hires are on a trial by fire 3/4 month temp worker position causing unnecessary stress and the hiring of some people that shouldn't be there. Honestly this whole office wouldn't need to be here if Uber spent some time fixing it's funnel operations. How is it efficient to allow someone with one phone number to make over 20 accounts but only allow them to use one? Why aren't there better instructions during the sign-up process so people upload drivers licenses instead of selfies? This office is here to help fix those problems, but they don't address the root of the issue. Poor design on both the app and in how Uber as a whole is organized."
"Losing your seniority when converted, it's as if I started all over again. But worth it either way!"
I can't see this by now
Uber has grown too explosively and there are so many people doing the same thing. Too much redundancy and too many people now.
"Not enough hours, just part time - This is a con, but I knew this going in. They were very open about the position."
THere are none that I can think of
Holiday season is the worst. They take everyone off of their usual account to help with the heavy call volume. All of the calls are BS and you are not empowered to handle anything during the phone call. Everything that you can do the customer can do themselves on the website.
I can't see anything wrong with the work place and people that I work with.
"Sometimes it´s complicate, just because as everyone can express your opinion, have a clear guide or take a quick decision can take more time then expected."
No negatives come to mind when reflecting on UBER and it's structure.
Requiring a lot of energy and motivation
In too much media light lately
"Managers who are supportive, proactive, and empathetic are unfortunately the exception, not the rule. I imagine some of this stems from scope problems (most managers simply have too many direct reports; my first had something near 20), but if you talk with engineers, there are a scant few who don't have a story about how their manager really let them down during a promotion cycle, review cycle, or project in a manner that was obscurantist at best or callous at worst.Teams often try to parallelize the product development cycle. This has repeatedly been the source of a lot of stress and thrashing on important projects. Engineers will be asked to work in parallel with product and design contributors, meaning that as the product design changes, engineers will need to follow along. It's often unclear when and how a design will change, or even whether it will change again; there's just not a good communication pipeline or standardized workflow on a number of teams.If you're an engineer, there's an immense onus placed on you to drive the success of your projects. Engineers are the last filter between a product's idea and its implementation, and so the responsibility falls on them to account for not only product edge cases, but gaps in design documentation (which is never formalized, and usually just a set of slides that requires a follow-up meeting or three to clarify), and team workflow.In short, the culture is that if anything gets in your way, if there's any blocker you hit, if anything at all is unclear, that is YOUR sole responsibility to surmount. This creates a lot of stress, because it is at odds with being thorough in an environment where productivity and throughput are first-class engineering values."
There are no downsides at all
no cons detected within my experience
Short staffed. We just need to hire more people.
- A tiny bit disorganized; which is understandable given the speed at which we are growing.
"Weekly travel, not a huge con but the drives can be long"
6 months interview process;Non-clear selection criteria;INSEAD Mafia is trashing the company culture
I have no cons to mention!
"You will be treated like a child. Your manager will be paid more than you to do absolutely no work at all except for complain about how little work you do, even if you're one of the top performers. It's so hard to put into words how horribly you'll be treated here. Despite Meritocracy being a cultural value, favoritism runs rampant and there is nothing you can do about it. They will tell you they value your input and then do the opposite of what your pain points are. Bottom performers are praised or settled with, rather than asking them to do their job. It's literally so hard to even conceptualize how awful it is. Over half of the agents in my department are looking for new jobs because of how bad it is, and we've all been here for over a year."
Lack of developmentPerformance Reviews process not great
Work about 10-12 hours every day on average.
"Due to Uber's rapid growth there can be quite a bit of ambiguity as it relates to goals, projects, etc. This can be frustrating for some, so if you're looking for a consistent day to day with clear metrics, Uber might not be the right place for you."
It ramps up so quickly that some onboarding tasks are lost in the mix.
-Pay isn't that great-Not many advancement opportunities-Commute
Very long hours to work
"-Leadership: Despite central leadership is fabulous in Uber, but in the cities, nobody cares about employees via questioning GMs or Managers if business KPIs are good. Sometimes, managers are being assigned by some GMs without passing quality criteria, just because of personal relations and trust, whereas it might be chaostic for a team if you have a senior who is unable to lead or coach.-No gross is available if you're already a manager and your team has an existing Senior."
- All the infrastructure layer are done internally. We don't use any of the cloud public offering like AWS or Azure. Not sure how this will scale in the future.- Lack some structure and process around scrum management and more generally around engineering and management.
"No upward mobility, low salary, disorganized internal management"
You have to learn things on the way. The learning curve has to be fast and you have to figure out how to do things by yourself most of the times.
None that I can think of
policy implementation sometimes does not happen.there are team managers who gives favor to agents and does not give proper expectation to agents. environment is fast paced however we should always make sure we provide proper expectations to avoid getting negative feedback
There is a lot of data to keep up with. Opportunities in the kick off sessions and trainings
can get too fast paced at times
"Heavily rely on data to carry out our duties, when data breaks, it is a pain point."
"New Company, still have flaws in the process"
- Brand health - company is working to fix it. Well done!
"Uber is not good at estimating the travel time to your destination. I have picked up meals in mid-town only to have to drive across the bridge to West Sacramento for a delivery. It may say 10 mins. but in actuality, with the traffic it's generally longer. Because it registers 10 mins. you're paid practically nothing for using up $6 in gas and a lot of time. This has happened to me twice already! You go above and beyond to deliver the food to the customer while it's still hot, and you're lucky if you're given a tip."
"- Lacks a fine tuned process across design and engineering. At the end of the day, incredible things get shipped, but at the expense of a few headaches.- Makers and independent contributors often get side tracked by a plethora of disruptive meetings."
"Definitely has less perks than the other big software companies out here, outside of Amazon."
Long hours operating the vehicles (typical shift is 10 hours). Uncertain if we are working ourselves out of a job or if there are likely career paths beyond vehicle operations when fully autonomous vehicles are realized.
Due to recent events and news reports Uber is really making a great effort to become a cutting edge workplace not only from the tech side but also on the people side. More to be done but all is underway and it would be unfair to mention past issues or jump into conclusions about the future at this stage
No cons. This company is very inclusive and well managed.
Growing pains.Growth opportunities is as much as before
No remote option to work from home sometimes
The last 8 months have been rough but we are getting through it and building for the future.
- Competitive industry --- sometimes strategy feels a bit too reactive to competition- Growth over profitability
"No room for growth. I've been at the same spot for a year and have tried to get involved in as many projects as possible, but they can't provide raises due to the fact that the pay is set as a standard. You could be pulling 40+ hour work weeks and still be getting paid the same as the person who is slacking off and works 20 hours. There will be people that make you feel belittled as an Expert and point blame on you for something out of your control. You do get treated like the ""help"" from the higher corporate levels. The turnaround for this job is REALLY high."
they should increase more facilities
"I have been an Uber Eats “partner” for about 2 weeks and the experience so far is sub par and moving towards horrible. Their sales team will tell any lie to get you to sign up and once you are onboard the support staff (account manager) lack experience and education in dealing with small issues and complaints. They don’t have a quality control process in place to ensure that food delivery is sanitary and protected. Their training is based on a short YouTube films. They use the same drivers that pick up people. Their drivers are not trained properly. Don’t be surprised if you receive your UberEATS order by a kid on a bicycle without any warming bag (this may be acceptable if you live in Manhattan or densely populated urban area). I really take great pride and time to ensure my customers receive a hot and fresh meal. Quality of delivery is just as important as quality of food preparation and service. To pay a partner (UberEATS) 30% of my net sales and have them not ensure quality of delivery is unexpectable. Don’t try complaining to higher ups because your complaints will go unanswered. I am really concerned for the public and restaurants who partner with UberEATS because they are both risking safety and business liability. For the general public be smart and have someone you can hold acccountable deliver you food before you get sick. Restaurants be smart and measure your liability risk factor when you have UberEATS deleiver your product in a dirty vehicle, no warmer bag, hanging off bicycle handle bars or by unprofessional individual."
"I can not find anything, I like everything in my job"
- Interview and promotion process can change drastically from one year to another- Trying to higher above average talent with average pay.
Nothing I can say as of right now.
All the bad press about the company as if we all were responsible for the mistakes of a few people
"Slow to tackle the cultural internal problems, still doesn't have some simple procedures structured - it's not a startup anymore but it still looks like."
"- To absorb everything at the beginning it can be difficult;- Things move extremely fast, you need to adapt to this reality quickly (not a bad thing per say)"
"startup mentality, lack of planning, few senior level employees"
Very minimal but the food can be a bit healthier and a better gym partnership (if any).
I hope to have a good rest day. haha
Salary is embarrassing. I am legitimately embarrassed to tell people how much I make for the job that I do. I work 50+ hours a week and have no work/life balance.
"Structure, career path, safety, feedback."
"- Uber is indeed a lot in the press, and often for bad reasons, but in truth it has very limited impact in Ams office / EMEA region"
A lot of work
None in the 3 months I have been employed.
There isn´t any cons that I´m aware of it.
-Some inefficiencies and overlaps between teams and roles
I can't be a uber driver
The public controversies mean that you find yourself defending your company a fair bit. If you really really care what other people think of you you might find it hard.
Company-wise collaboration spirit was under-developed; and projects are sometimes redundant across teams (but both are changing for the better).
"Low pay, online meetings, minimal communication with management"
Location and no remote optionsTime taken for interviewsScheduling delaysToo much time commutingToo many management changesSingle product company
"In service area, professional growth is not well defined and feedback is not constructive."
Famous for bad press even though things are great within the company
None to mention at this point
Org changes are frequent and with limited transparency. The leadership Merry go round can be exhausting. The negative PR cycles can be distracting.
"Lot of functions are becoming more centralized in hubs in the US. If unwilling to relocate it is tough to move up. It has grown quickly and is feeling some growing pains, but they will be overcome."
- Fairly time demanding it's hard to switch off from work- Dealing with constantly being in the media spotlight
You need to hustle a lot
not enough compensation for full-time work. Tips are few and far between.
- almost no benefits- lack of organization
Can be as stressful and time consuming as you let it--it's up to you to resist such temptation.Strict NDA and a constant target for negative media.
"Lots of leadership changes (a positive too), Lack of spot bonus / kudos bonus"
Company changes so fast and often you never know what your schedule looks like or which part of the country you will be in tomorrow. Also moving out of the DVO ladder is extremely difficult.
"The reputation. It's entirely outside the company, and influenced by the media and the less-informed perceptions and rumours circulating through the community."
"Have to be careful whenever we go out of the office, cause most people will ask so many questions about the company, about Uber, etc. whenever they saw or hear that we're working with the company."
The work can be a bit monotonous.
The return package for a full time employee is not large.
"No ethics whatsoever. They dangle the ""employment carrot"" without any sincere desire to offer employment. They don't care about restaurant owners and seemed to not care when restaurant owners felt 30% was too high. The company is weirdly full of people who throw around buzz words that they picked up. So ""hustle"" ""swag"" and a bunch of other ridiculous words are thrown around to rally up morale when going into the office naturally just kills any good vibes. I was really good at what I did and There's no way I would ever go back.The temporary staff office is the US version of an Indian/ bengaldesh garment factory."
Very little focus and poor management.
"I don't get a bus pass but that's not a big deal. I get Uber credits instead! We get bad press, but it's helping us grow and improve for the better."
"The Phoenix Training Team (TREX) is not organized. They have a person running the PHX training that does not have experience and does not know what he is doing. They do not treat the ""Mentors"" with respect and completely degrade them even thought they are doing they job of a TREX member without any additional compensation."
"Politics-heavy environment. Quality of work is absolutely secondary to personal exposure. Incompetence rules. Every small office does whatever they want, how they want it, at the only advantage of the local despot."
Missing communication about careers opportunities. out of the blue you'll have some position...like it was for for yesterday!
I yet to comment on this
"I think Uber could have some program in selections to increase racial diversity. I'm black and in Greenlight where I work, I feel little represented. Brazil is the country where the population is 55% black. Diversity is accurate."
Compensations & Benefits are mostly in stocks instead of cash
"I work a 30 hr work week, which is considered ""full-time"" but I wish I had 40 hours, it's honestly something that I debated before taking the job."
The pay was not great at all. Scheduling always changed. Management was awful and there is no chance at advancement.
-Clicki Culture-Interview process selects for a very narrow group of people-Start-up culture
there are times when updates regarding process and policies being implemented without prior notice
Nothing i can think of
High growth and speed are at times counterproductive
Work Scale is rotative which is not a big problem.
Too far from convenient stores
A few residual repetitional issues from the US
Growth is slow and progression is not certain
"- Difficult to find your footing, if you're not a natural self-starter- Not all processes are in place or very clear"
Not good food at lunch or dinner. Free drinks but there were no bottles of water. Need to have more food.
i don`t have nothing to complain
There are some uncertainty's as far as growth and job safety go. Overall great place to work while you are here.
"Actually, as cheese as it sounds, i have nothing to complain. Everyone is so supportive, so cheerfull, i'm sorrounded by inteligent, capable and nurturing people. Today i reached the 3 moths mark and my life changed in a way that i'll never be able to thank enough."
"Engineering leadership is very weak and nontechnicalAttrition is high on teams like payments. The management team has not been able to hire top talentA really weak CTO, non technical VPE"
Because of the company's leniency some employee are abusing it.
"With such a fast paced business, you'll need to be willing to set your own boundaries for a work/life balance."
There are no cons to work for this company
The public have a misconstrued perception of Uber which means I constantly have to defend the company.
"I'm disturbed by the fact that employees at uber do not have provident fund, what happens when one leaves the company coz its not always easy to save."
"Doesn't feel like tech people are first class citizens, more like a PM centered place.Lot of incompetent senior manager and directors with limited prior experience promoted because of playing politics. This has become clear during recent turmoils: not many true leaders, but tons of people who call themselves leader.Recent changes feel like meritocracy has been replaced by a bunch of people on the top serving kool-aid on a regular base."
"Still not clear when to ipo, no clear plan to ipo, not sure if Rsu can be turned into real money"
Management does not care at all for you.They fire people if you complain about management.
Not too many. Maybe its hard to get the hang of some tools in the beginning because some things are not as clear
"1. The on-boarding process is slightly disorganized at this moment, which tend to leave new employees at a lost.2. Company's current PR standing is not for the faint-hearted. Negative press coverage almost every other week.3. A lot of work still to be done on the HR/ employee management front, as trust needs time to build."
Very novice management staff and management style. BPOs has better way to run their operation and have competitive management staff.
"The business is young, and still finding its footprint in the world. While it often feels like your career is in a rocketship because of the nature of the work and business is fast-paced, this can be frustrating in your career if you don't know what you're getting yourself into. Some people don't like a lot of change in the workplace, and working in less structured environments."
Few possibilities to grow. A lot of administrative problems
- Long working hours- Lack of work life balance- Does not pay very well- Culture can be overwhelming- It can be very competitive
-Dealing with people who are severely frustrated
It's not super fun when drivers vent about whatever situation they're going through - especially when you don't have the ability to improve it. It can be frustrating but worth it when you can help.
none cant say much of a downside
Nothing to complain about so far!
Meeting face to face with disgruntled Partners can be intimidating at times.
Bureaucracy and overshadowed by top performers at times.
One of the cons of Uber is that there are not enough meetings and confirmed information.
Dealing with traffic and LOTS of miles on your car ( about 20 miles per hour avg. over 10 months working). Weak support system but little needed.
Working hours and compensation is not good. Tends to take away away much of your personal time.
"Work life balance can be better, but it more depends on person's choice"
"Uber is a popular company, many people will ask you what its like working there.Uber has had a lot of negative press lately.A very diverse group of people sometimes makes me nervous that I might accidentally offend someone."
"Because it is a young business, they are still working on defining their selves and finding structure, policies, and business programs that best fit their needs."
There isn't any cons here.
"ATG will ignore important Uber initiatives by saying ""We aren't a part of ride-sharing, this doesn't apply to us"". That can be frustrating, especially when a program/training/experience becomes available to Prime and you feel it is important."
Nothing at the moment. Uber is great.
Not found any cons as of now
Currently going through some leadership changes. Fast paced work environment.
too much internal politicsit used to be about smart people and smart ideas now its about who can play the gamethis is particularly relevant to oversight from Singapore - heads of functions have no idea how to actually do the jobs they have been given completely out of their depth and dont like being challenged
"* the negative press can get to you - it's constant* if you're used to a company where all the processes are up and running and there are robust systems and programs, this is not the place for you* lack of leadership"
"Genuinely can't think of anything, I love working here!"
"Sincerely, I don´t have much to complaint"
The sctructure sometimes is not of the best.
Working here can be overwhelming. There's a lot to juggle and there's rarely ever a minute where you feel on top of your work. Hard to get promotions here. The environment is stressful extremely intense. There is not much room for growth because career ladders aren't build out especially in the HR department.
"Mostly: the outside image. Explaining to your friends. Having to justify to friends why you support Uber and why Uber is a good company. But if you believe that fixing a problem that causes 30,000 deaths and countless more accidents a year is important, then come work at ATG."
Training program could be better and changes could be communicated a little better.
"growing fast so there are redundancies for work, old timers feel they own the place but that is changing fast as I see"
Nothing! I can't complain at all!
"The organization. We mostly care about is it, But we know that living in expansion gives us this negative point."
Thankful to no be there anymore
-Having to defend the company at parties
not many - some markets have shifts but the managers are willing to make them comfortbale for everyone
A lot of changes every weekNot transparent
"I miss leadership training. Because we deal with many people, it would be really cool if we could be trained to deal calmly with any kind of situation.Especially in cases of police officers and people who have been rejected."
"The communication of new products has yet to be improved a bit, because the information ends up being delayed."
"Sometimes communications delayed, but not so horrible"
Training program could be better and changes could be communicated a little better.
"Extremely fast pace, needs proper time management"
"- Sometimes move too fast, and expect more from you. Basically bad work-life balance. But they are trying to change this, so lets see.- Company is not cash heavy, not profitable -- so perks are good but not as good as some very profitable companies."
"Aggressive - if you want a laid back culture, not the right place for you."
A lot of duplicated efforts. Need better organization.
Can be exhausting to deal with constant negative press
"- Always connected, very difficult to switch off"
PaymentAdvancement opportunitySecuritySense of valueJob Benefits
- Location of office in Phoenix.
"- Goodbye to your social life. We were expected to be in-office 12+ hours daily, and online during the weekends. My team would make side comments when I hung out with people outside of Uber - it's like joining a frat or sorority, you're either in or out.- Lack of professionalism, career development, internal training or structure. A hot mess! (Which also gives you an opportunity to go around your boss and create your own job - or take theirs).- Aggression is openly tolerated.- There's virtually no HR and harassment and unprofessional behaviour is tolerated.- Hubris in the international markets. Most of my colleagues thought there were so ""cool"" to be at Uber, that they failed to localize marketing campaigns. This is why Uber is not doing well internationally.- Pay is way below market, compared to other tech companies and growth!"
"The negative media [which is often unfair] gets you down sometimes.There is always another great project, so it is hard to ever feel ""settled.""Compensation used to be low but that is largely fixed now.Hours used to be bad but this has got better."
Need more information on whats happening
- Too stressful- No work life balance- Cut-throat culture
"Some press does not seem to like Uber, creating poorly balanced articles that do not reflect reality. This could affect some employees that care about press. Not a problem if you care about work environment, professional development and solving challenging tech problems."
Culture is toxic and change will take time.
for me there are no cons
-Lots of work to do.
Organizational structure as some people work for multiple post
Bad communication from supervisors for certain events.
Terrible culture and management team. No work life balance. Extremely long working hours and hard to get vacation days to recharge. You have to work even when you are sick.
"Leadership. Some of the down side to working at Uber, unfortunately, is the people in a position that allows for bad team leads that are antagonist allowing inappropriate commentary to be made. The majority of contacts that we handle are global and diverse, yet, within the COE, diversity it's intolerant. There is no other support besides an English language support so many times contacts are resolved due to ""foreign language"", never receiving support. ""Oxford English and comma"" plays a huge role in our QA when it shouldn't be necessarily the focus and take away from the actual job description and that's providing actual support. Also, they promote within, rather than hire an experienced person in position externally, a non experience person as a lead who also doesn't have a clue about the job responsibilities they oversee. This is bad management."
"I work away from San Francisco and the internal challenges Uber faces are more SF based. The external challenges are more global. You need to really believe in the current and long term goals of the company, you will question yourself and be questioned by others but you truely believe then you will become a great advocate for the change, both internal and external we are making."
Some processes need to be improved
"I don't see how I could work elsewhere where the total package could be more awesome than what I describe above. Perhaps if that would pay a lot, then maybe, because cash compensation is below market standards, but then big part of your compensation is in equity."
"Culture, management, lack of leadership."
"Not for everyone - long hours, but really rewarding work."
- Sometimes too many tasks you need to deal with at one time- Not all the processes are perfect (sometimes still like you're working in a garage startup)
Not reliable financially and need more incentives...
The #Hustle value is not for everyone. It is a daily basis and if you don't get used to it growth will be almost null.
"*Very young management with no leadership training*Processes are in a huge heap of mess*You get tossed around departments in a jiffy*The team is only as good as the person managing it*I see other team are in good hands; unfortunately, my manager is not open to feedback*I work for a team involved in highly sensitive issues; but issues are not treated fairly*Culture isn't realized in small teams (it's no longer a 'feel small' company)"
"- No career opportunities for smaller markets/teams- Worst management I've ever had, no one cares about us. When i started here, it was a lot better.- Everyone is talking about culture but there is no culture at all"
Not easy to love a firm that is currently undergoing so many bad reviews... Gap between press and reality might be sometimes challenging.
"Almost everything else, I loved working with other distributors and providing this fun, new service in LA, but Uber cooperate was never the best at communication or providing benefits with it's workers, unlike UberX, distributors needed to be dependably on time at various partnered restaurants six days a week, driving to and from distro sites and dispensing food to the Uber drivers for delivery. We were classified as 10-99, but had to fulfill the demands and expectations of a full time employee."
Some bad apples in the company
"Hacky and inconsistent processes, unclear career progress"
I don't believe there's any.
"Location, it may not be very hard for me to get to work but I hear my co-workers ranting about traffic since the office is in BGC."
It takes your full dedication
"No dress code, college/high school environment, non existent leadership, way too much Kool aid. 'Talk' but no 'Walk'"
Very fast paced - not necessarily doing the best thingStressDifficulties to in work/life balance
"Iowa is a lower priority, and changes can sometimes be slower than other areas, but there is merit behind that, and justly the size of the market here."
"The external perception of Uber can be unfair. Also, if you're looking for great salaries and titles and career trajectory, look elsewhere. People work here for the work directly in front of them and the ability to impact the future with it. If you need a title to justify your self worth, you won't get it here. Also, if you're outside a main hub, there's no growth opportunities."
the long hours are rough but do able
"Nervous and ""toestepping"" environment: people spend too much time on showing off in front of the management instead of doing real work. Too much of the career focus: your teammates can step on your head if you fall down :)"
"Many of the problems we're solving have never been solved before; it's software fusing and transforming the physical world in profound ways. You can't exactly ""coast"" as a PM here lol. It's not like we're tweaking a login flow everyday..."
"Interesting shift times, technical difficulties."
"there is a big ""turnover"", i don't understand why."
No company paid pension. Not much space for personal/career growth. Life/work balance is not great as there were a lot of meeting in later afternoon or evening time. Some bureaucracy in company culture.
can not think of any as of the moment
There were some cultural problems noticed. Management is working hard on fixing it.
"The companies site lead can be a bit condescending and patronizing. I've spoken or worked with her directly, but in site wide meetings she always seems like someone you wouldn't want to cross paths with.Training was a bit too long. I wish instead of 3 weeks in a classroom, there was 1 week in the classroom and 2 weeks of hands-on work."
The perks for new hires have changed a little.No stock participationLess Uber credits
I have nothing to say about what can be bad on this company.
Things outside of your hands can sometimes cause lots of difficulty during the workday.
Managers didn't help with improving skills on am individual basis. Didn't feel like their policies were customer friendly
"-The staff; when they're not pounding Uber's asinine and excessive 14 company values into your head, they are spending absurd amounts of time telling you about how negative press or public opinion is just wrong.- From the moment you begin, you are expected to fully adhere to any and all rules and regulations. There is no space for learning curves.-You never know who your supervisor is until you complete four weeks of training.-The shifts you have to or could work are entirely different than the shift you are trained to work."
- we're definitely experiencing a lot of growing pains. there's a lot of changes that needs to take place to get us to where we need to be from a culture/work environment perspective but what's kept me optimistic is that the leadership team is receptive to change and are in fact a huge advocate for it. It's been a tough road the last few months and still a lot of work ahead but we're definitely seeing changes and progress.
"No surprises here: Travis. The leadership. Performance. Growth. It's all as bad as it seems, if not worse. The longer you've been there, the more legacy actually can hold you back. The glass ceiling actually feels especially low for women."
I will let you know when I find out
Sometimes it feels to me that the company should have more age diversity. It seems to me that Teams should have some more senior people.
"Uber is about as toxic as it can get in terms of places to work. There's a macho, fratty atmosphere and everyone is expected to do battle for everything. You compete against your own teammates and are forced to be an aggressive to survive and climb the ranks. Even doing things that are ethically wrong are encouraged, so long as it's good for the business/growth."
Run by a sociopath - culture is highly toxic and deprrssing. The recent suicide is a prime example of the type of company Uber is. It may win but management here does not care about creating a great place to work.
Below-average salary for associates and interns
"Uber moves quickly. Most of the time that means having exciting and challenging projects. However, that also means projects occasionally breaking down. In those instances, it would be more useful for team members to take a step back and figure out how to move forward together."
It is still pretty young and some processes still need work.
"Poor middle-managers, constant restructuring, good ideas take a backseat to politics and clicks."
Hours can be long
"The early hours can present a challenge, but nothing impossible"
uber drivers are sometimes difficult to deal with
"Not necessarily a personal experience, but from what I've had peers encounter: a lot of young managers who are learning to be responsible for a large group."
Some internal stuff needs to get improved but it can be healed by time.
"It's a lot of work, but definitely rewarding!"
As any startup still no clear roles & responsibilities
None for me so far.
Lots of freedom and a relaxed pace often means lots of time for an insecure recent college grad to think they're under-performing.
"The systemic paternalism and bro-culture is absolutely real. If you're a woman, be prepared to be chronically cut off mid-sentence, 'forgotten' off meeting invites and second-guessed. Depending on the team you're in, you'll be the only woman around. If you're unfortunate enough to enter a team that's been together for a long time, you have to really work hard to be included, but don't be too pushy - or else you'll get dinged for it on your Performance Review. I kind of feel like you can't win."
Work hours are insane. Some days went up to 12-16 hours and there were times were I had to work weekends. There is also a disconnect from old employees with large equity shares in the company and newer employees. They see newer employees as a potential threat and this can sometimes cause strenuous office politics.
"Rapid growth has resulted in some lag in organizational development. In other words, lots of developers without much framework like PMs or tech writers to help guide and amplify everyone's contribution. It can be challenging to work someplace that receives significant negative press."
"I work in a good team, so i don't have any notable cons.However, all the negative media attention that Uber has been receiving in the past few months is sometimes disheartening."
Lack of alignment in some orgs. Lots of re orgs. Not all Managers are fare. Favorites and friends benefit. Managers are not technical don't know enough about candidates and perf is in their hands as they represent you in calibration. Culture is more like deliveries over employees well being. You are expected to stretch indirectly through peer pressure. Highly competitive environment.
It is really innovating organization which has become the need of almost everyone.
If I can find any i will be sure to let you know.
I have not come across any cons in my time here.
Because they promote within so much and most of Uber employees are in their 20's their can sometimes be managers that are a tid bit inexperienced.
They stole my copy of Susan Fowler's book from my desk.
"• Still developing in Brazil, but I know it is just for now"
"The company is very far from home. I just would like to change my working time because it's being hard to do other things, like gym and so."
The downside is the same as the up. Uber's culture brings out the worst in employees who aren't conditioned for competitiveness.
Constant policy changes (might not be a bad thing for some people)
"Compensation is heavily tied to the growth (stock) in the company, less salary than other firms seeking competitive talent."
"Infra poor for big data, (overloaded data center hardware, vmware overloaded, do not monitor the network infra, overload the physical machines even when the infra team swears to stop, ML, availability, SLA/OLA complianceSome managers good (my original hiring manager), others suck (my second manager hates contractors, does not like women who speak out of turn)Basically Uber is a low cost operation."
"Poor Leadership with no experience which makes for poor quality of work being produced. Its young, and trendy which results in immaturity and drama. No space between desks which so speaking on the phone awful.  They preach upward mobility within, however its more lateral. Education isn't valued here"
"Point system is strict, and takes a year to fall off. Although you can move departments, there really isn't an option to move up. They drill it in that you can move up, and its easy, to move up; That's not true. No room at desks. We sit at long tables with no dividers or space. It can sometimes be loud and hard to make important calls.  Its trendy, and a lot like high school. Rumors, jocks and cheerleaders. A lot of fraternization, and favoritism by management. Others can be harsh and judge your work..   Most management have no idea what they are doing and spend a lot of time chatting, or texting on their phone. If there is an issue, good luck. There are a lot of things that take place that would NEVER happen at another employer. Very young, and mostly inappropriate.    There are a lot of changes currently happening and big adjustments. I'm hopeful that the immaturity will be addressed and the office can become more professional."
"The payment had a delay for some weeks, last 2 weeks was ok. Sometimes is not possible to be trained in time for the needed department ."
"- Uber has a bad reputation and is constantly the subject of controversy, protests, and negative press. While Uber is not perfect, I do believe the company has matured since its early years and leadership does take these matters seriously from what I've seen. If you can't handle seeing a negative headline about your employer, Uber may not be for you, but for those that can handle it and want to make a positive impact on our culture and reputation, this shouldn't be an issue.- Teams and people can shift around frequently as the company continues to grow. This is probably a good thing overall for the company but it can feel jarring at times.- People work hard–not necessarily because of deadlines but because many of their coworkers are smart, driven, and hard-working people so the bar is set high (that's my experience at least). This is ultimately what you make of it–many people stay late but many people also get into work past 10:00am. Remote work is pretty flexible too which is a plus."
"The importance of staff at certain times is low, and the knowledge of managers on business and personnel management can be improved."
I dont have anytihing bad to say.I love this job and i want to make carrer here.
"working time its long enough i think should be a way to keep personal stuff in the building, like tooth brush, toothpaste, personal care stuff like a locker."
- A misinformed public perception / lack of positive PR can be taxing on employee morale- Big hours as a result of running lean teams- Extremely fast paced
"Growth in company, Better communication."
"Communication, last minute updates hours before product launches, lack on timely response from other lines of business"
Very fast paced and long hours
Non-responsiveness from some upper management (pretty much to be expected)
"Low pay, low mobility, low morale."
Long working hours because of lots you can truly own and resolve. Perks are not as good as big companies.
better training for the new and current employees
"Human resources, mobility, employee support, work schedule."
"On-going changes, but it's an advantage at the same time! Always learning something new."
Schedules. But of course that's almost with every job.
To be honesty their is no cons for me personally about working for uber. I love everything about this company
Toxic Culture is killing the Eng orgNo clear direction
"The opportunities to move up are very few. They indicate that there is plenty of oppotunities to grow and move up in the company, but it hasn't happened for the 6 months I've been there. The work schedule is never set. It can change in a month, in a few weeks or in a few months. The company doesn't really provide any feedback as to how we are doing. You would think we would get a 6 month review and possible increase in pay...nope that hasn't happened."
"culture, culture, culture, work-life balance, growth rate"
Too much favoritism. And no room for growth. Promises they never keep. They can't handle strong minded employees.
Intense pressure to get all things done immediately leading to high levels of burnoutPerformance reviews could be more transparent
I honestly cant find a Con in my personal experience.
Share info a little slower
