"Too explain this part i would like to be more elaborative .Being at OlaCabs is a different experience altogether for me , As i am with OlaCabs from past 9 months i have seen the company changing (being more narrative) from generation 2nd to 3rd in my terms.With this growth i felt immense growth in person as well.When it comes to responsibility , culture and as well taking down the competitive things in market place as per technology perspective this company seriously nails it.I wont miss that 2nd generation or say old time was not so in comfort with Olacabs, But now things have changed alot in better ways. Working and riding with Olacabs on this Technology plane so far is awesome and i am still enjoying it. This company has a clear funda work hard and party harder."
"1.Things are changing for good. Started focussing on work-life balance of developers.2.Providing every possible help required. Be it technical or just another life problem.3.Good to see people using the product you made, everyday for commuting.4.You even get snacks and drinks served on your desk"
"* Successful startup, few startups in India see the sort of traction that Ola has seen* Young team, driven, aggressive, want to succeed* They will listen to you, might not act on it.* Loads of money, so unlikely to go down anytime soon"
