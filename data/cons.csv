cons
Iterative Abuse from Partners some times due to some technical issues
"Cafeteria can be improved.Vendors keep changing,but not food quality."
No appraisal as already a tenure employee of this company
None for me except for little politics creeping in management and transparency in team
"Nothing as of now, was a remarkable experience."
- unless you are extremely lucky its unlikely your work will be noticed by top management- line managers are below par and get promoted purely for retention
"1. Requirements come on the fly2. Too much hierarchical, not easy to expose your work to the leadership team."
some management folks were highly egoist
"No job security , No incremental for third payroll employees"
No work life balance. Its a 24X7 job

"Paid foodMinimum perksToo much pressureLess credibilityBaised Performance AppraisalOnly if you know politics , you can survive for a longer period of time.Low salary hikeJust one tennis tableNo other gaming or activity area"
*6 Days working* Work life balance
- More structured hiring formats required
"free food facility has now been removed, they have paid food nowappraisal cycle is not transparent, they give hikes based on experience and politics"
No structure and no value given to seniority (age wise)
nothing found as of now
Nothing! less politics will be helpful
"Nothingflexible, salary hikes is very less for Executive level"
Need to manage work properly
"You may have to stretch yourself at times till late night, but that’s manageable."
- Less focus on tech nowadays- Less focus on people
Timelines are very strict to complete the assignemnt
Worst HR working like a puppet Run by whims & fancies of one personFounders & HR get into ego fights with competitionNo business clarity. Entire company runs on project management & pleasing the founder through illogical pptsNot even a single good leader has staid back for a yearEmployees who party & spend time with founding members get undue growth & other benefits without evaluating their business contribution
work life balance is not too good
No respect for working hours.No one expects you to have a personal life.To management is fickle minded and sometimes too self consumed to see other person's view
-- Software and IT team are the privileged ones.
Should have been overtaken by competitors
"Lots of irrelevant work, they don't know what they want actually."
Politics and no value of employment.
Lack of Job discrimination and Profile
1. Zero cultural events2. Doesn't provide transportation
Work life balance is bit difficult.
Food provided is very poor
"Employees do lots of work just before a meeting with senior management, rather than before taking a decision."
No structure currenly...managers are bad
Startup culture doesn't fit all
Not an employee friendly companyBusiness drivenLess pay but more work
Restricted growthRestricted incrementLacking culture
"poor work life balance, things shift instantly and you are expected to be always available"
Unstructured work - feels being stuck in infinite loops
I don't see any cons
Ola is a trastable company
Don’t have any suggestions too
Lack of Structure & System
"Politics, Discrepancies and bad management, work satisfaction is not there,High attrition rate after coming to Ola nobody want to stay here anymore due to bad quality of work and high management push to get things release ASAP."
"Every place has its share of politics so is Ola, mostly in the management"
60% of the work in unplanned (ad-hoc)
Too much politics.False encouragement to undeserving people
need better growth for all
"- I know startups are a bit random but still after these many years, there should have been some planning on how they execute things- With startup turning into a big company, workload has decreased and new things to learn have also decreased"
Poor software architectural choicesLack of good leadership and a high attrition rateVery Weak Data Science Division. Doesn't use cutting-edge techniques. No push for research or writing papers/patentsNo open source contributionsThey clearly lag behind it's competitor in tech
"Startup culture, hence a lot of hustle"
unrealistic targets & too much politics
"No HR policy getting leave is not easyOvernight work is compulsory here, be ready to miss your weekend plansNo work life balance"
Ola has the worst HR culture. People in HR are only making money with zero contribution. Especially the recruitment team in ola is pathetic. Lots of new people hired in TA Team to improve the structure but is of no use. People involved in leadership hiring is worst.
"From 7 years i work in automobile service centre on the post of service advisor my company experienced like (maruti suzuki, honda, hundai.) Recent i work in hyundai service center in varanasi (u.p). And attend all company (hyundai) traning those relateted from service centre."
"Life in Ola is like the ""Dark Emergency Period"" of my life. It felt like a jail with no one to hear your voice. You can be called at any hour to work and your work can be thrown on your face at whims and fancy of your leader. And yeah you can also get fired if the leader is in a bad mood."
Lot of politics.In competent managers with boot licking ladder all around.
Prod issues can come any time
As it is in the process of getting structured one should be comfortable working in an unstructured manner for a while.
"Extremely bureaucratic - need to be ""yes sir"" type for career progression."
No words to say good company... appraisal part it will low
1. Worst Management2. Full Politics3. No respect for anyone4. Micro Management
"No or little planning from Business to product that trickles down to engineering.No respect to engineering planning in real terms during execution.Lack of documentation or knowledge transfer (expect you to hit the ground from day 1)Lot of micro-management, boss needs to know your whereabouts all the time.Lack of respect for employee work-life balance.Lack of real growth in terms of real learning, career advancement courses."
A little chaotic. Stringent deadlines.
Few Years back - Chaotic and Hectic. A settled and decent process flow has been set in the last 1 Year. Stable Now
Work life balance. Process and Systems
work life balance might be a worry
"good company, but need to change in some policies"
"Politics due to middle management, laterally hired leadership who are biased and trying to create their own preferred culture which is deteriorating the best thing about Ola - great work."
"Sometimes work is too hectic and you will be forced to trade off quality for urgent fixes and releases. Design is not posh, so developers end up implementing not so good design"
2. Product and upper management
"Some Senior Leadership are not good. Not clear what they want for a task , so you just feel like sitting there."
"Prioritization's, which is problem across startup's. What you think important may not get prioritzed in project work. Product/Bussiness requirement is priority."
No job security . People are let go often
Not true across teams. Have heard not-so-good stuff about few teams
unqualified persons promoting to next leave
"Poor work-life balance, lot of upper management politics"
"Roadmaps are changing very fast, Many time it creates a lot of confusion."
Increments have become stagnant.Work expectations of a start up but beurocracy of an MNC.HR can improve.
no such thing everything is good
No comments as of now
Tight on timelines on projects.
Nothing to specify as of now
BAD AND worse culture with pathetic HR
"Hectic Work Life, Work Life balance zero. Specially if you work in Driver Team, Ready for on call 24*7."
Changing environment like process n other internal factors
Need patience to climb the ladder
Need to change all management staff .
Nothing much to say about cons.
In some teams there is too much work load
no cons as such to share
monotonous work and no changes
change in plans too frequent
"Well OLA has Whatsapp and BA (business analyst not Bhavish ag.) culture. So, there are following layers in OLA - 1) CXO (analytical, young and quantitatively smart) 2) Director to VP: (Let's call them dogs). Great in running Indian company OPS. Even though OLA is suppose to be a tech company, it has lot of people with Sales / OPS background in FMCG companies. They have no clue of data3) Manager to AD (Mazdoors): They have varied skill set but most are from IITs/IIMs4) BA & AM: Business analyst who is mostly an EA to Director and above levels.Whatsapp culture:For any program at OLA, a whatsapp group is created in which even CXOs are present. Then the whole team of the project gets added to it (including BA & AMs). Mostly a project requires cross-functional stakeholder management. So the senior leadership of other teams also are part of the group. So there is the CEO, Heads of other functions and core team managing the project (till BA/AM). BA suddenly realizes he has an amazing platform to create visibility, so he starts messaging non-stop in that group. He even starts questioning other functional leaders in that group who has to answer because well CEO is present there. All of this continues and no works gets done on ground as everyone is busy building visibility on whatsappBA cultureLet's look at the ORG structure above. There is mostly 4 layers - CXO, Dogs, Mazdoors and BA/AM. Now, Bhavish is a control freak. He will review work on weekly basis (daily if needed) which should be strongly supported by data. Hence the DOGS (who has no clue of data) are highly dependent on the BA that they have in their team. These BA prepares Bhavish's (or other CXOs) ppt. BA starts to command whatever he wants. He would be empowered by the Dogs to question the mazdoors. Mazdoors are suddenly being questioned by BA who has 7-8 years less experience than them. In time, most of the Mazdoors leave the Org, some become Dogs as they have learnt OLA's whatsapp style. BA lose their career track. They are unable to find any job outside (as they haven't worked much on data) , they try to shift within OLA on business / Ops side and get stuck here for life."
"timings, work culture, the structure of the company"
Might be too aggressive for some!!
"There is no defined career track for the analytics function. No training programs, not much say in the ongoing tasks. The leaders here hire their colleagues from previous companies and ruin the work culture."
"Constant team member changes, more agile world"
Extremely stressfulNo work life balance
Lot of bias in the system and employees are treated badly
Need To Best Changes in apps
Too much politicsManager pleasing jobAll credit taken by your manager
Lacks vision & focus. Unable to retain top talent.
I did not find one yet
Top management changed frequently.
Central teams have good work life balance but city teams tend to have less work life balance
Everything works here is by using buket :)
Less Hikes & Bonus on appraisal
"Honestly i don,t see any negative activities."
"Lacks in finding employee’s talent, Need to improve the overall management, No transparency"
"- Average hike around 10% across company, financially will be a slow growth year or year- will always find one unreasonable manager to work with- middle management is too large"
Ambitious management leads to chaotic environment.
Immature management and change in vision and plans every day
Not a startup any more so approaching managers is not that flat.
Nothing that I can think ofI left it for another company which was offering me a good package so have nothing against ola
"Culture, Dumb Managers who are leading"
Management is poor.HR respondes very late.
1. No work life balance. You are expected to work 24 hrs a day and 7 days a week. Ridiculous.2. No focus and too much chaotic.3. No salary hike. Bad appraisal process.4. Extremely unfriendly HR.5. There used be good people who have joined from reputed companies. Everyone left. Nobody stays here more than a year or two.
leadership doesn’t realise the potential of Old employees
"Horrible CultureAmbiguent ProcessesNo TransparencyOpenly endorse profanity.Cheap Manager mentalityAbusive to hardworking employeesI worked my life off and sacrificed so much and helped every way possible.These guys at the end turned the tables and asked me to resign. Worst they didn't even measure the performance fairly.If you don't cozy up to Seniors in the org and showcase your every move like an attention seeking person you wont last.Don't join this company - join uber or any other startup with fair policies, other companies have started to reject ex ola employees - not kidding[5 of my friends have been rejected]don't believe the news or media - the company is burning VC money and is not going to be profitable in the near future.Yes it's still under Loss.They are making the same mistake repeatedly, hence they are going to get the same results"
"Technical skills are not as valuable as your skills to flatter big ""people"".Work is not very challenging, you will do same work just using different tools and frameworks(at least for web and this is true for most of the teams)Don't expect hikes(it's generally a one digit hike).Your rating depends on how well connected you are with managers."
"No work life balance, nothing to learnStupid engineering and product managersZero or very little appreciation for your workBiased and unfair performance reviewsBad office politics, nepotism, and arse-licking culture"
peoples are working here for years together but their don't say i'm earning better than previous because when you enter that salary remains for the future
"salary issue, improper management"
"As with any other startup, things can get a bit hectic"
Not organised due to startup
They cheat the drivers alot
No work life balanceVery dynamicObjective of any campaing changes instantly
the process should be more structurednothing as such
1. . Attrition 2. Frequent changes in Management 3. Looks like saturation has come in certain products 4.Processes keep on changing
"Unorgaised, No structure is being maintained, As co. say that things are getting automated so employees are being moved out but again these employees are being used to get the manual work done"
nothing I have found..
Lack of communication with the senior managementTreat you like fools and dispensible since you are not part of the elite MBA grads for the marketing and PR.3rd world treatment in terms of benefits since this is not corporate but Customer experience team.
"Where do I start. There is absolutely no leadership, planning and accountability taken by any leaders. Directionless but always get blamed, treat people very badly."
- Work-life balance- Culture building- Can be stressful at times- Lack of structured processes
"politics, no structure, managers"
"No job security,harrasment is common"
"long periods of work, no offs"
Less Recognition for your work
The main challenge is the management... The shift timing never changes
1. Ola is still maturing in terms of vision. Hence things get started and scrapped off in a giffy.
less pay than other companies
business gets the highest priority. tech team is always under pressure of deadlines
Management is not good.HR does not play a good role to support any issue.
"Completing the given target, knowing every places coz Google can't always be right, making sure the ride is comfortable for the guest."
Some hardship because of the intense bangalore traffic
Work culture is not up to the mark
pressure of work load randomly.
"Good Support from all channel,Work free nature!!I was fresher to this company it creates good platform for my CAREER!!!"
Not really nothing needs to be improved for them
Firefighting approach hinders the long-term vision for business or products
"Nothing, all manager are supportive . You focus your work your growth definitely"
"Long term planning, Goal setting and clear expectation out of the role - can be improved."
No thing that i can think of.
"nothing i remember of , good experience"
"Almost no foreign trips, no trainings, no cabs. And a bit boring life."
People management is just the worst. Managers treat employees as entities rather than as humans. They're just devoid of emotions.
Bad senior leadership and disorganized work
Employees are not recognised for their hard work
Structures and processes are not robust
work needs to be streamlined and PM's more organised
very frank and non-formal culture
1. 6 Day working.2. Little Work/Life Balance. Expect business calls on weekends and during other leaves.3. Lack of competent talent in the top management.
"Not much for management, already intelligent"
Work pressure is too much a lot of times
"No cons, Company is very good in all terms"
Some times has longer route to reach point A to BNo salary Band
-Politics in upper level-Upper level will not groom you for next level
Crony culture prevalent. Not recommended for senior proffesionals
"salary not according to calibreRetarded, unprofessional and selfish behaviour of most people"
"- Worst company without direction, so lots of useless work with huge pressure to get it delivered asap and THEN direction change, your work might get dropped from plan and new work will come in.- Work life balance is non-existent. There are lots of leaders doing nothing. My Manager just use to do browsing full day, and only used to pressurise team to come in at 10:30, he used to come at 11:30 though. Oh you have to stay in office till 7. and still if there is any work left, do at home sweets:)- Hike have been minimal since 2 years, Because ?? Oh Yes, they are making culture.- Anyone random is at any random post. a 5 year experience guy will be senior director. and most higher ups are useless fellows, they have no idea what they are doing. At least take leadership coaching or join some part time leader ship course dudes."
Nothing I can think of.
"Ridiculous upper management comprised of the dumbest individuals. Product leaders are astonishingly stupid and incompetent.The culture is very negative and toxic where higher-ups start their day by abusing people working under them and end their day with tackling some made-up problems using their pea-sized brains, all the while ruining the experience of their customers and cheating drivers, who have been forced to take such huge loans.It is very sad that people in such positions at Ola make crores in salary and stocks, while there are so many skilled and hard-working graduates in our country that are unemployed. And they claim they are helping grow the nation.What a tragedy!"
There is no downside of working at OLA specially at senior levels.
organizational structure not that much smootherWork/project division is not proper
Management is not up to mark
Manager approval for engineering taskProduct management support
work life balance is a myth
No transportation provided and nothing else.
Poor management and planningHR team is very poor
fast development leads to poor quality sometimes.
"1. Frequent dips/outages but not much of a headache for freshers but for senior devs.2. Lot of prod issues,tasks in on call hamper work-life balance.3. Work life balance is beteween average to poor ; but management is trying to work on it by setting early office hours"
stopped innovation and repeated work.
- Customer support team campus needs an upgrade
Work culture not upto mark
"Shockingly poor people in product leadership roles. Focus is on shipping the requests from operations/business with no cohesive product vision or direction. If your hiring manager had been parachuted to product leadership role with no prior product management experience, that’s a bright red sign!Hostile work atmosphere. You are on 24/7. No one with work satisfaction. Non-existent HR. Everyone’s waits for the one year completion & every month there’s at-least one instance of someone running away within a month of joining!Study the consumer App, make a booking, talk to the driver and evaluate the entire experience to make your own judgement!"
Work life balance is difficult sometimes
"Pathetic middle management. Not much growth opportunity for regional office- based employees, as opposed to corporate office ones. Non-existent HR."
A little unorganised at management level.
I did not find any cons
High attrition and lack of processes takes away motivation to work
1. Heavy work load2. Internal politics in teams
Recognition is slow. Expectation is too high.
one day off is bad
"Good company, flexible timings, free alcohol"
It's okay when you're in but when one's out it's little difficult
Some times people are speaking in Hindhi
- low pay- lack of direction & company goals at L1 level- management is too full of themselves
Too hectic and becomes myopic due to looming meetings with leadership
no cons are their in the management
not good work life balance
No Job SecurityLess Career growthDelay in getting approvals from top levelNo proper communication from Senior Management
"- Managers have too much power so you can't go against them as no one will listen (encountered a lady manager who just likes to work w/o thinking & expects everyone to follow)- Very high attrition (Lot of good employees leave within 1-2 years)- Useless HR, No quality solution"
"too much hierachy, too much distance, variable compoents more"
As of now we haven't got any downside
Poor work life balance here at ola
- Open ended KRAs- Brash management style in certain quarters
"Leaves, travel, reimburse, expenses, management"
HR need to be more active.. Hiring & firing policy need to be improved by upper management..
"Salary- peanuts, no benefits of travel, hr issues"
no culture how to work and why to work
"long working hoursdidnt invested on infra (no cubicles , engineer are working on tables )no proper processincapable hr"
"- Everything- Worst management, who keeps on working on random products- Try to force people to work more than 10 hours- Useless HR, No quality solution"
EQ is the lowest and No recognition
Management is not good. Things are not organised.
too much ambiguity of roles & lo of overlapping
- confused and short term planning- micromanagement by the C level executives- high attrition- marketing as a function is not respected
i have joined as fresher and working as SDE 1. part of incentive team there are few garbage people who is spoiling the working culture of the team . Only Politics left in this team (INCENTIVE) due to some idiot and political SDE3 .All the work is done by SDE 1 /2 and SDE3 just withdrawing huge package to play dirty politics in this team and insult juniors in front of everyone.SDE3 even dont know how to give update and talk to the higher management .. for any technical discussion he will call the junior SDE1/2 ..as he dont know what is happening internally in the application.
Nothing as such. I like the place.
- wee bit bureaucracy and bias- doesn't function like a tech company. Largely plagued by poor leadership and cumbersome process- not the place if you want a good work life balance
to much pressure for work and late night
No proper corporate structure since it is in Startup phase
"Less impactful work, no more startup anymore"
"+Prime example of how a degree is chosen over experience+Horrible work culture, people are made to work on Sundays and odd hours+Great divide between elite business school people and the commoners, almost like a divide and conquer policy+Superlative perks passed onto the city head and category head levels, I strongly recommend external audit to check where the investor's money is going+Insurmountable pressure to get incremental business which does not exist, and stupid amounts of money spent on it. The risk v/s reward ratio makes no sense+Extremely high attrition rate because HR is no good and people work without ethics"
It is very good management i loved it
"- High dissatisfaction due to high stress, in human deadlines and impossible target setting.- Not much resources ( financial) to substantiate the expectations.- The priorities keep changing which creates role and goal ambiguity."
"Extremely arrogant - I-know-all attitude of management.Expected to work on weekends for full hours.Just because they pay you, they expect you not to have any life outside Ola.When it comes to firing employees, they won't give a second thought - the hard work, countless weekend hours - nothing matters."
Lunch and Dinner are not upto markNo cab serviceNot a good work life balance
- Not very consumer centric- Lack of great Product Leadership- Poor HR policies- Poor quality Product thinking & execution in most areas- Too much bureaucracy & politics
zero Job security. You wont ever know when your name will be in cost cutting list.
Nothing to mention about cons
"Bad work life balance and lack of proper processes causes lot of difficulties and waste of time. Worse is, it causes executional challenges"
"not secured,Any time you will be terminated"
"Unprofessional city GM, always shouting and shows no respectHigh level of pressure created even in normal situations6 day workingNo long term plans. Actions are taken to achieve short term goalsPeople leaving in mass due to dissatisfaction"
"People just work here for the pay, no culture or any connect with the team or organization.No hr policies. Still exit process is dependent on mails. You might not get relieving or experience letter on time. HRs are literally useless and inhuman."
"Extremely high work pressure, 6-7 days working. Work gets repetitive"
WorK-life balance is very bad.
Sometimes manager can be fussy.
No major cons working for Ola. Just expect a lot of work
Too much pressure on employees to finish task.
i didn't feel any
Poor appraisal systempoor retention policy for employees
"Work politics, late night work culture, bad hikes likes service company in 2017. Managers are biased."
"Drivers in company are not trained at all, very bad corporate program that brings bad user experience"
"Chaotic Org, No direction, No long term Planning"
Lacks structure. Good talent not put to proper use
good team of ola cabs
"City head of Mumbai ( keeps shouting at his team, hr and even admin people, cannot handle pressure, no value-add on operations, )"
change of policies might affect you
"Everything should be finished in 2 weeks , So only naive solution comes which is simply not working"
"-working hours - starts late ends very late.- employees starting to become complacent, so no rigour in work anymore.-sense of ownership is being replaced by insecurity across the company."
"1- You do not know when the Work Volcano erupts, you get dumped with a lot of work all of a sudden2- People are lazy, and getting work done here is a tough job3- HR team sucks to the core4- No parity in salaries, lots of overpaid jack heads will be above you5- Racist culture in many teams"
Bad process/planningHigh workload at ola
"Round the clock work, most of the time."
"Management always look for outside, they can give options to experience"
"Monotonous work, less opportunity to grow"
Nothing as such to be a disadvantage.
Management Vision is too low.
"- a sea of chaos, especially at senior levels- incompetent directors and managers- a lot of yelling, blame game, favoritism and cunningness is baked into the culture- shoddy engineering and ""jugaad"" prevalent all through the company"
"Huge amount of irregularity in workloads and opportunitiesLow visibility for talents nowNo more a startupUncertain reviewsRecent cost cutting measures has hit employee satisfactionHiring below par, probably as they no longer need/afford good talentBureaucracy is finally hereMud slinging and ball passing behaviour on the rise"
Unstructured work environmentNeed to maintain visibility for getting any recognitionShort-term focus
- People speak their region/mother-tung languages always in office.- Higher management plays little bit of politics.- Delays in yearly hike/appraisal discussions.
nothing else to share on negative aspect.
"1) Extensive politics - People in higher management are mostly prejudice , More than work , if you are a political person this place is best for you .2) If you are part of business team still your life is save , Dont ever join team such as IT , Admin , Hr , They are treated as per with house keepers as they are not business facinng team .3) Job security - No job security , you always be in trauma that at any point of time , for any silly reason you may loose your job . No warning , No discussion .4) If they are offering a high salary package , or if u are an senior or already getting a high packet please do not join , it is too much risk very unstable place5) whimsical Decision -Random decision by management, any thing required , they required urgently , no proper timeline given . All childish hiring people firing on next day , opening office closing on next months ."
Internal politics and shift to various department. Crowd is not that great. No good work culture. HR sucks.
"Nothing as such, HR policies are amateurishly designed"
"Where do I Start from:If you want to ruin your life come so come join this organisation.1. No Work Life Balance2. Minimum 10-12 hours Daily3. 6 Days Working4. Get Ready to do anything and everything in OLA. Dont go by the job title you have been offered . There is no role clarity in this organisation.4. Management doesnt have any clear vision5. Strategies keep on changing Daily.6. If you are YES boss material and dont have an opinion of yours this is your company.7. HR is Just there to hire and fire people , dont even think about employee engagement here.8. Biased top management."
All cons only. No proper response from management for any concern.
- People speak their region/mother-tung languages always in office.- Higher management plays little bit of politics.- Delays in yearly hike/appraisal discussions.- Young managers.
- High pressure / big expectations from everyone (of course this leads to high paced learning also)
"- Extremely confused company- Most C level executives do not make sense and do not deserve their titles- Cluttered & chaotic workplace- Unrealistic targets being driven down into teams - most teams fail- No sense of a state of winning as a company - Few teams get all the credit- No respect for time of others- Some very junior level folks have climbed the ladder too fast and hold a lot of clout- Very short term thinking, no long term sense of the business"
"Time management, needs to have proper management."
"- No Particular cons to mention. One needs to have a purpose to be at OLA, If they have their purpose, there are no negatives."
"Not Many. Management can be better, they only watch you do targets, hardly of any help."
"Very strict management , they follow their policy up to the mark . Little bit work pressure . But work pressure is required for all to grow themselves ."
too much pressure............too much calling
1) No cabs for employee2) lack of process3) there is delay in appraisal and hike every year
1.Randomness all over2.insensitivity3.imposing management4.No work life balance
"- Unstructured approach to development, ad hoc decisions (slowly changing though)- Quality of resources is a concern; mix of good and bad; can be testing at times- Work timings are bad, but slowly improving- Management needs to be more open; changes are happening, but much more to do"
Ohh boy where do I startNo proper canteen ( don't even think of free food)Very bad office - GurgaonUnrealistic expectationsHuge work load - 14 hrs per day - 6 days a weekDumb Central team.Employee is a slaveNo cab facility being a cab company (shame)HR team does nothing but hiringEmployees are ticking time bombsStress levels are astronomicalNo proper vision. Need for automation. Heavy manual work.Futile work is ordered many times.Manager demands to work at nights.Hats off if you are working as an analyst for more than a year.
"-so much manual work, needs more automation-HR & Admin teams need to improve a lot"
"Myopic focus, Incapable middle-management, under appreciation for employees"
No visionSalary is low.No proper work timings (depends on your reporting manager)Job safety issuesGrowth chances are minimal as top level hiring is done from iits & iims.
"NO talent, No place (now company started hiring only through off role), hike and growth is bit unsatisfied"
Culture of the company is not good
Lots of work to do so bit horried and tired work culture...
"1. Pathetic Working environment.2. Product Managers are big time jokers,they don't know anything technically and sit at you head to complete the task.3. One thing you will learn for sure Politics!!!4. No work life balance , for namesake they say they follow agile ,but you will be working for almost 14 hrs a day.5. Experienced people(A BIG WARNING),don't ever join this company otherwise you will be screwed."
Two week-offs are more preferable for those working here.Two-way transport system or procedure would be more beneficial to the employees.
"1. No respect for the current employees, basically employees and drivers are same for the senior management2. Quick and Dirty work is appreciated as opposed to good or great work.3. PMs aren't aware of what effort goes into tech and come with ridiculous deadlines."
1) No proper HR policies - PF contribution is just 2%. Medical reimbursement started from the middle of the year. Still no policies around WFH and Leaves. All depends on how manager takes it.2) Bad Management - Appraisals were delayed by 2 months. No proper feedback the whole year and then they drop the bomb at the time of appraisal. People with 3-4 years of experience are made tech leads with no proper management skills.3) Office politics. Quiet new to me but its a part of the company culture.4) High attrition.5) People getting away even after not doing any work.
Work culture wise no issues
Reporting things are sometimes very irritating. There might be few people who wants things to be done in hurry by compromising a little accuracy.
"Although you get to own and develop, you kind of get caught up in the politics of the company. And the Development managers do not have much technical background, so they do not understand the nuances of the feature and tend to push the feature as fast as possible, in order to score some brownie points from their higher ups. Sometimes they push developers to work on features even before the requirements are finalised."
"This place is now too big to follow the startup culture. The whole idea of ""I needed this yesterday"" needs to be dissolved and approach needs to be more practical."
Appraisal vise this is not the company yo go for...It gives hike only around 7 to 10%
the company believes that only money motivates people to work. They make you work like bonded labours. No learning or very less learning. Many people with low/no expertise are there in the top management. No work life balance as you are a bonded labour. Hiring is very slow and new joiners quit within a few days.
"Horrible mid management, every one is politician here . People full of ego. Not a healthy sustainable environment. Horrible HR Department. Amount of work to salary ratio is skewed."
"Huge flow of calls, should develop the app more."
I have been trying to withdraw my PF and have send out 1000s of email to exit team with no response. OLA is really bad company when you are in it and also after exit the team there is very un professional.
- Work life balance is not good- Need to work on weekends as well somtimes
"Senior Management needs to improve Work Life Balance of employees and need to do regular one on one's with their immediate juniors. And, there is no culture in Ola so people pretty much work on their set of tasks and interact very less which is not good."
Inexperienced Management always in hurry to launch a project and In day Management want a change in productivity as well as sales.
management is not good. high pressure job
1. Bad Management2. Bad Leadership3. Stupid work culture4. No Employee engagement5. Highly biased
1. Incompetent Management2. Too much favouritism3. Harass employees if you question them - zero transparency
1)You never know when they will fire youAnd for what reason they fire.2)Don't expect long-term career3)No proper way to implement the strategy4) No importance given to your experience5) Fresher's from top institute's run the show
Unethical nature in DNA of CompanyNo transparencyUse of abusive unparliamentary words by managersDelay in salary
"non incusive , no respect for employees or their personal time , lack of learning and there will be no career growth . you will end up doing a job much below your capabilities"
Long working hours but great learnings
same boring work again and again. people may not use it afterall
Growth comes only with an iit tag...Others are considered as hard workers or highly paid labour.Your culture depends on your manager
* Some teams are not managed properly.* Hectic work schedule at time* Less work-life balance
Lot of hiring leading to lots of politics
"Unsatisfied customers, Yes and listen to them"
"1. No growth in the company for hardworking people, growth meant only for the people who can please the management (as mentioned above)2. HR officials will not care about whatever happen to an employee. Only the company matters to them.3. Please forget about the pf from this company ( no value for your hard earned money)4.No job security ( you can research for the reason why they thrown you out of the company for rest of your life time, but you won't get a proper reason)Never ever join this company, better start a pan shop."
"Working from home is a norm, working on weekends is occasional.. However it's not much of an issue since generally its exciting."
Their no people management. Please learn the things how to be with employees.
Need to adapt quickly as possible
"Tons of cons:No work culture and when I say it, it comes from the top.Constantly stressful environment because manager commits unrealistic timelines & expectations.Employees are treated as some code writing machines and are not given worth.Bad Managers - a lot of favoritism & politics. Some managers don't even have the expertise to become managers.No Knowledge transfer or training for new ppl.Team bonding activities are never done.HR will not help you in any issue.Senior mgt takes pride in ruining your weekends.In all, the high percentage of the attrition rate."
- work distribution could be better- unrealistic expectations
Nothing bad to say about company
"Uneven distribution of work over time. Sometime the work load will be decent, some time you will be over worked. Bad HR team."
"Fast growth environment, pressure very high"
"I really dont know where to startwith , however i would share the following before someone takes up roles in Ola.1) The Seniors are probably either some startup founders or some IIT / IIMS who couldnt do better abroad & joined here & so you can expect zero help from your bosses.2) HR without Backbones & work towards only Talent Acquisition & not for Control Of Attrition.3) Opens Departments after new funding & closes Departments once a fool in the senior management fails to Run the show. Eg- Ola Cafe/Ola Store /Ola Shuttle.4) Disrupting Career as they fail to retain employees after hiring them, then you dont know what to do & where to go."
Basically Management should be proper.
1. Pathetic senior management.2. No focus on automation.3. Micro management from directors.4. Proxy managers buttering senior directors.5. Weekend are not yours.
"No work life balance. No respect for efforts put in, only thing are results. Each person is stretched to perform the work of two and hence everyone faces bandwidth issues in attempting a new exciting project. No training is given but simple work is handed over resulting in immature decisions."
No benefits.Harsh managementIf you are a programmer you are saved if you are CS executive you are treated worse then animal.
not much to learn so tough to grow
*Scope to improve focus on core problems
- death trap for good engineer
Company still stuck on the startup title. No HR policies defined in the new divisions. Too much focus on adding IIT/IIM folks to the team (even if they're incompetent).Huge inequality in terms of salaries of people with the IIT brand name & others even when the performance levels are sameAppraisal only once an year which is sucky if you are outperforming yourself each day
"Everything, HR policies, management etc etc. Sometimes I think, how they will satisfy customers when they cannot really take care of their employees."
- Not a web focussed company- Work like balance
1. Super arrogant and biased HR team.2. Zero transparency3. Zero motivation to work.4. learning definitely gets hindered in such hostile environmentetc.
work overloadedno proper professionalism in officeno HR supportno proper knowledge give employees for new plans.
"Poor management , No vision"
"sudden lay offs, long time for approvals"
"Not so much, THE AVERAGE TECH STACK, UNSTRUCTURED THOUGH"
Work Life balance is not good
- No work balance- No process- fast paced company
- Poor Start up to Corporate transaction- Doesn't really care about talent
You will be highlighted only when you are from IIM or IIT . Sad that most of the top graduates does not know the ground reality which affects the product and fire the employees with out any reasons.
"hectic schedule, no work life balance"
Not much as of now
Lot of work but then that is the point of start-ups where you get to learn more
work life balancethere is no process
No growth.No disciple.Bad environment.Assistance managers don't have managing skills.No proper management.
"Ohh....the Managers...Most of the Managers are arrogant, think of themselves as the owners, transfer their work to their subordinates, and HR department is even the worst."
"Work pressure, very fast, highly outcome focussed"
Poor Managementlow hike6 days workmore working hoursno structure
No Cons are there in OLA as it a well managed environment.
lot of work and deadlines
Your experience depends lot on team you will end up with.
No as such. Work life balance is less.
Management team does changes but did'nt inform employees.
still not have any proper work process in management.
I see no cons in working for the company full time as well as for a part time job.
No clear directionNo value add to my CV
no cons it is a good company
"management need to be more effective,"
"No Structure, Redundant work, No life"
"Lots. Not a good place for freshers as they are slaves here. Not a good place for experienced people as they will soon get divorce or they will die of heart attack or hyper tension. Not a good place for managers and directors too as there are plenty and are all looking out. No one stays in this company for more than a year, but ya few of us have survived."
Nothing that I have come across as of no
"No work life balance. You can get a call anytime, even at 2 AM in morning. Meetings get scheduled at 10 in the night and continue till 1 in the night.No proper holidays. Even if you have taken a leave, you will have to manage all your work and receive calls and attend meetings.Business is pretty much driven by top management. So, even if you have a good idea, it won't be entertained if it doesn't fit top management's thinking process."
"No work life balance, false sense of urgency sometimes, not enough team building"
The only thing i regret is having a 6 day working for the city teams.
"1. Process Paralysis2. Not worth to claim, it's an IT company3. Unplanned actions in every management move4. Less Transparency on every aspect"
"Besides the above pros, everything is cons, yet few are below for a glance:-1. Think about this company who suddenly informed their finance executives all over pan India on 31st March 2016(whom were busy for closing accounts as it was last day of financial year) that:- ""Today is your last day as your post is now redundant for company.""2. Bad Senior Leadership3. Uncertain Appraisal policy:- As after working for more than 15 months, didn't receive any appraisal. When asking for reason HR said:- "" pls ask to your seniors regarding that"". When asking to seniors, reply is:-""We had proposed to seniors for those who didn't receive any appraisal, may be you will get it in june month"".   After that on 31st March,2016, we received relieving letter(May be this was the way of the company for giving appraisal to employee who worked day & night to make the company stand in their city.)4. Worst Ground Level management5. Preference to sycophancy6. Non Supportive Leaders7. Nil Training Programmes8. Appraisals/Hikes are not based on performance basis. It totally depends on your connections with higher management."
"I don't see many, as this is my first job."
it is a little disorganised at the task distribution level.
Work life balance can be tricky
No cons as if now senior managers are well behave and always ready to figure out your problems
- gets overwhelming at times- not suitable for a slow worker- sometimes personal life suffers - the nature of industry is like that one has to be on toes
Pathetic top managementDo not know why they are doing what they are doing
No cons right now here
Its been a good ride so far.....nothing that comes across as a con.
Nothing that I have come across as of now.
Nothing much..everything was very good..so no complains from my side
A lot of politics and no transparency.Need to value people across functions
appraisal is a nightmare because they will show some fake records and will not provide a good hike as i worked there for 2 years and the end i got 0% hike despite of my performance and skill and experience. The management in Ola is full of politics
"With smartness and the ""IIT/IIM"" tag comes a lot of arrogance. People are good in general only if you prove yourself to be of similar creed. Titles matter a lot despite being a flat organization."
Release iteration is slow due to the number stages in the release.
some confusion work.bit difficult learn.
- The top management is too confident about its opinions and may be missing out of some really valuable insights from the employees- No benefits provided
More manual work even though they hire as SDET
sometimes work becomes hectic but its worth to be the part of industry
Nothing as of now. Overall a very energetic work environment
PoliticsIntermediate dependencieswork cultureEvaluation process is pretty bad.
"They hired peoples and laid off with in a span of couple of months. Just before 3 month in the month of March 2016, many of the Finance Executive & Operations Executive faced the same issue. They will inform suddenly in a single day that "" You are being revealed today"". Didn't expect such kind of thinhs from this reputed firm registered in the name of ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd"
little over ambitious ! total chaos
work & personal life is shattered
"Promotion only for IITians, no clear sense of direction, some departments over rated while others werent even looked after"
"Too long a list.NO RESPECT FOR PEOPLE. REALLY BAD CULTURE.People, even at management levels are expendable and robots to the senior management. Being aggressive is one thing and being abusive is another. Ola senior management treats employees in an abusive manner.They will make your life miserable even in afterlife (once you leave the company). Really bad culture.Employees are staying only coz the money is too high otherwise everyone is sad and hates the work at the company."
"Repetitive work, no follow ups, work unorganised"
Most of the early employees of Ola are very rude.
-No Culture- Ambiguity everywhere- Hire people for new initiatives (unreal experiments) and once initiative looks nonviable they fire the entire team.
"Bad management, no work life balance"
"No work life balanceToo much chaosUnnecessary push to engineering teams to deliver very quickly, even when there is not much business value from what is being deliveredNot much focus on engineering excellenceToo much of politics at higher levelsNo job security, people getting fired when they least expectedBeing a cab company, they don't provide cabs for their employees"
"In work life the life part will be missing.Mediocre managers completely worthlessUber drives this company , even city teams are made around Uber and not uber teams."
rest of all is cons
"Higher management is useless, manager think they are Dictator. Not a place for Tech people, they run away in just 6 months. Simple App and they think its rocket science. No policies no process (simple phone reimbursement policy was rolled out a month back). bunch of jokers."
"very high work load,Unprofessional behaviour by HR at Olagrowth will be slower going forward"
Little bit difficult to balance office & personal Life
"1. Its a chaos. Even though the developments claim to follow agile model, the requirement keep on coming even on the last moment of deployments.2. People are gauged based on their connections.3. Appraisals/Hikes are not based on performance basis. It totally depends on your connections with higher management.4. The product managers have no communication in between them, they always come with contradictory requirements within themselves. No considerations are given for development efforts required. The deadline is written as line on rock. Everything boils down how uber does a feature.5. No constant leaderships in management. The managers keep on changing in every one month.6. No job security.7. Interview is taken altogether for a different profile when compared to the one you're hired for ."
"1. Worst management2. Its an operational company and not the tech company.3. You are supposed to say yes for everything4. Product managers has only one strategy 'HOW TO COPY UBER IN BEST WAY'. I don't know why do they need product managers from IIM. They can hire detectives, detectives can get UBER insights quite easily and earlier. No need to wait till UBER publishes a news about its new launch and developer will get at least sometime to launch the same product before uber.5. Blame game is always on6. They will make you work on weekends on very nonsense and non critical things7. They will force you to work whole night even if you are dying.8. No peace at all and it will impact your personal life.And never ending list goes on......"
"Horrible work life 12 hours, 6 days a week is a norm here. You are expected to work round the clock.Managers are very incompetent, if you are a manager in a big comp you may get a higher role here. Very hierarchical company, more than peoples competencies you will be known by your title.Incompetent senior management, everybody is told explicitly that they are replaceable. Constant fear of getting fired. People are afraid of taking leaves as post vacation you might be replaced by some other folks.No appreciation."
Everybody in middle management are looking to save their job by making groups and manipulations no body cares about company's vision. Some stupid managers plays with others life just to save themselves. Most of the managers are immature with no experience.
"It's very very shameful that the way Ola app and the Costumer care is working these days. I think Ola people are taking there old customer for granted as mistake can be done once not twice or thrice. And Ola is only focusing on sale rather than marketing and specially when we talk about so called ""safety"" that to be WomenSafety in Ola cabs is zero... Last night around 9:30 I board in Ola cab due to there GPRS and App malfunction driver drop me on a highway, even drive has discuss this thing with one of the customer executive, and his words were this is the place ""Madam ko wahi Utar do""... I was not able to get any auto from there, anything can be happen with me.And the same thing happen with me last week. And when I complain about this issue they give me scripted apology and even now I am not able to book a cab due to the same reason...Ladies now think twice before booking Ola as they can drop you anywhere, they are basically focusing on there business..."
v bad time delay in cab dispatch team is uselss
"Imagin what cab driver do, if he got huge money suddenly"
the work is so enticing and exciting that it will eventually eat you up before you even realise it and eventually you get habituated.
Insecure job they may just use you and the the team leaders might never support you abusive languages by the manager the heads .without any reason they may fire you .The TL might fire you any time and creates his own policy or work timings .carelessness that if you are fired asks your resignation and makes u work on sunday .No one to listen your problem or they never pick up the phones.
Trying to do too much
No Cons as of now
"Working late and across the weekend is 'expected'. The leadership is perpetually working round the clock, so the 'culture' is to just follow that. If the boss is in office on a Sunday evening taking reviews, his entire team spends previous 36 hours in office prepping for that.You might say startups are supposed to be intense, but this is a notch above everything that I, my team mates and my friends at other places have seen/experienced. Ola has a few thousand people now and is not a garage startup anymore - things need to change with time; organisation needs maturity..period.Working weekends & late nights is not the core issue but the whole culture around 'expectation' that employees have nothing else going on in their own lives is what ruins the place. An old-ish employee recently left since her boss was not willing to give anymore time off to recuperate from a pretty serious illness. People are made to feel very guilty about taking any time off. Holidays are just a thing on the calendar that nobody cares about - Aug 15 or Ganesh Chathurti was like any other normal weekend with people coming in late and leaving early at 8PM for dinner.Almost everyone in our team has either worked or has friends in other startups in India - this place seems very different & very intrusive in your life. People leave as soon as they hit a year. Prospective hires just don't accept offers from this place even with better compensation/roles etc"
"""No work-life balance - almost 12-15 hours of work daily plus connecting once you are back home"
Nothing much about cons side.
- Lots of internal strife and politics- Ineffectual top management- Quality of people hired is very poor- Office lies in a dump
- Some managers are undealable
Extended timings along with a lot of work can cause fatigue.
1. Un realistic expectations.2. Extremely rude senior management3. No concept of Saturday - Sunday - have seen people who haven't take a day off in 6 months4. 100% attrition rate within 6 months5. 15-16 hours a day + be always available on phone6. People get fired for a small mistake - so constant fear7. Overall not enjoyable work environment.
No work life balanceNo process and Management expects to work late every day
"Too Much of Work, Not Great Quality Work"
not that I can think of
HR policies and HR team is worst in response. worst Team managment
No Appreciation!Less scope to Implement Initiatives ( Strategic ).
"The HR department is one of the worst. They have created a system of so many approvals without documenting whom to take it from. The culture is pretty bad. Mid level managers try to take all the credit of the work being done even by juniors. The structure has become extemely beauracratic and you hardly even meet your head. Unlike a startup, whole teams keep sitting just because the boss is sitting."
Processes not streamlined and system not in place
I guess.. there is a lot of chaos due to the extra-fast growth the company wants/seeks for itself... very bad work-life balance...
"Now Ola has hired some very senior industry professionals but they are good for nothing only take home a hefty pay package but not worth a penny, they are clueless , only hire and fire with out even trying to explore, no USP of its own only Cut Copy Paste Uber, a lot of unethical practices, worst HR I've ever seen in my career simply pathetic"
Non-existent HR except for the hiring teamSprint/Agile is joke hereManagers are incompetent/bulliesDevOps is a govt office.Money isn't everything which is what most of employees realize after joining this company.People getting hired are very talented and from all the big organisations as well but getting misused by above mentioned managers/upper management
Non streamlined processes. Very high expectations. Work is not well planned.
Nothing that I can think of.
Can't expect too much growth now
"Most of the people on upper management are all high on degrees and low on practical knowledge. Hence you are on your own here, will not get much learning experience."
The new management create conspiracy against the employee. and no one their who listen the employee complaints.
"Accepting challenges is like gaining experience's, no downsides for ola"
"As this is a young company, It should be more careful about security & consistency with good growth and profitability in the market."
bad management and no growth
Nothing but will prove it once I go into it
not enough facilitiesoffice can be nicer
No work life balance . Not a startup anymore
"Nothing much to learn, There is no growth opportunities"
Ola doesn't have any Cons. Its a most preferred start-up to work for !
Not applicable really.. company worth working for.......
"See Guys,Please have a look at the mobile developers, as the mobile developers are not so satisfied with the current process. Eventhough if we get paid highly, work satisfactions is so important. Mobile developers are having intension to leave Ola. Think about it. Mobile developers are the key players in olacabs and Mobile apps are the future for olacabs. IF YOU DONT LOOK INTO THE PROBLEMS IN MOBILE TEAM, YOU GOTTA LOOSE THE MOBILE TEAM AND MOBILE APPS QUALITY. This wont help you in longer run. You have face lots of struggle to acquire this position. Please do no loose everything in a single day."
". No work-life balance. 2. Bad attitude of top management 3. They think just because they pay you, they own you. 4. No ESOPs for early stage employees. 5. Very very biased top management. 6. Wants to do everything right now attitude - Not at all focused."
Not the best pay masterLess to none equity options
Work hours are long. Little time for personal life. Can get too random. No process management. Unorganized roles.
Yet not properly organized in business processes
"1. No work-life balance. 2. Bad attitude of top management 3. They think just because they pay you, they own you. 4. No ESOPs for early stage employees. 5. Very very biased top management. 6. Wants to do everything right now attitude - Not at all focused."
1) Work is not organized2) Same repetitive work3) No work life balance4) Putting hand in all the businesses
"not organised, work life is imbalance,"
Many 'not so intelligent' people ruining the code quality and products.
everything is downside only better not to go for it
Most of the times people here work like dumb through out the mid nights and sometimes till next day morning also without sleep. Debugging the deployment errors throughout the night.No Proper Sprint planning from product and project management teams.And guess what most of the deployment happens just before on weekends thursday/fridays. For sure issues will come and your weekends are gone just like normal working days.On top of that all latest deployed app team members will be scolded irrespective of mistake at their end or not.
Sometime work load is too much.
The consulting practice shrunk so much that there is no career growth
little bit high work pressure.....
"Since the company is in growing stage, you need to brace up for sudden changes"
small offices. no in-house lunch facility
"Micromanagement, One person controls everything."
Things are very fast changing at OLA and too many moving parts
Recruitment of OLA is like lottery. One of the Test Engineer folk joined as senior director in Engineering. They easily could get good senior folks from Indian institute/REC/BITS. They don't know whom to recruit for Engineering post.
Bad work cultureNo work-life balance - almost 12-15 hours of work daily plus connecting once you are back homeNon existent HR policySnobbish and condescending attitude of managementNo career development
"Culture is screwed up. If you can work here, you can work everywhere else"
pay is not as good as other companies
Almost 12-15 hours of daily workNon existent HR policy. They won't even respond once you join them.No career ahead once you work here
"1) Immature and arrogant top management2) Exploitative work place - Unapologetic to ask you to work over weekends (on the basis of fake urgencies)3) Lack of mutual respect - bossy attitude in several managers4) No defined cultural or company values - Since values aren't established, and the current employees who are the interviewers don't share common values, the interview process doesn't select for people who have a specific set of values, and this goes in a spiral - results in mercenary work force; not employees aligned for a mission5) Random levelling; too many levels; several people with inflated titles - Inmobi has already inflated titles; since this company poaches from Inmobi, one more level of inflation - Due to inconsistent levelling, lot of insecure people who steal credits and don't act like leaders"
Mediocres holding bloated job titles in senior roles.
No Cons as if now
"Very unprofessional place with rude management in engineering. Bad place for software engineers, maybe good for senior management. Often false or non-transparent promises are made about work or compensation just to keep people from leaving. Very bad culture as compared to some startups. Many developers are unhappy here after joining."
Every Company has cons this has too like you have to be dynamic and competitive to cope with the growth.
1. Should have brought in senior/experienced people earlier.
"* No mentoring, hardly any senior people on the team* Very haphazard decision making. You are there mostly for execution* Load of churn in technology and product* Heavily ops and marketing focused, if you want to be on tech or product, reconsider and ask a lot of questions* No ESOPs even to early employees* Work like balance is a myth"
"1. Pathetic work culture. Only work, no culture.2. They will take you for granted 24x7. You will be hired promising a 5 day week, but they keep you chasing on weekends.3. Business heads and managers are not gutsy enough to say no to unwarranted demands of the management.4. No fixed appraisal cycle (its there only for namesake). No hikes/appraisal if you don't ask for it.5. No team building activities, no outings, no employee rewards etc.6. Workplace is analogous government offices/ post offices. No cubicles, no team spaces etc.7. CEOs attitude is highly demotivating."
"- Rude, Abusive & Unprofessional executives- Non-techie company- Culture & Values ! Don't think anyone there knows what it means !- Unrealistic expectations from Employees- Pathetic Workplace- Random Firings - resulting in scared work force- False promises - about quality of work , stock options ..- Not open for any kind of feedback and change- Management is a rare trait OLA has always been deprived off"
No training available. Due to high rate of attrition no seniors available for guidance.
Management is a bit immature as they are young (but they are learning fast)Hard work is there as with any startup.Trust between teams could be better
"Management is not much open, work pressure can be huge considering its a startup."
that its a new company so oly 120 cabs
work tension and miss communication
Work is too hectic sometimes
"Sometimes, few direct engineering managers try putting the blame on SDETS for anything and everything wrong that happens in production."
Lack structure and very entrepreneurial.
"-Extremely poor work distribution(Lead Data Science doing work of a junior data scientist)- Hikes are minimal(Good hike only for people in terms with the management). Negotiate a very high salary when you join.-Importance given to ""foreign"" degrees and Phd, though the productivity by Phds in the team has been 0.-Senior management involved in politics and showing poor projects as working great-Hiring one of poorest you just need to impress one guy rest of the interviews even if you don't know anything you will be hired.- Top leadership interested in improving their own brand value to get the next job. No contribution to the company."
Investment volatility and little unstably
Management Sucks very bad management the reason i left ola
